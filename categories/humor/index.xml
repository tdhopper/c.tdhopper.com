There was idle chatter&lt;br>
And a red build&lt;br>
And a gif of-&lt;br>
The cow jumping over the moon&lt;/p>
&lt;p>And there were three little interns sitting with mentors&lt;br>
And two little commits&lt;br>
And a backlog of tickets&lt;br>
And a little blocker&lt;br>
And a fresh Docker&lt;br>
And a PM and a DM and a glass full of beer&lt;br>
And a loud young salesman who was typing @here&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goodnight Slack room&lt;br>
Goodnight Zoom&lt;br>
Goodnight manager hopping on Zoom&lt;br>
Goodnight Jira&lt;br>
And the red build&lt;br>
Goodnight interns&lt;br>
Goodnight mentors&lt;br>
Goodnight AWS&lt;br>
And goodnight Bash&lt;/p>

Goodnight TypeError: null is not an object&lt;br>
Goodnight project&lt;br>
And a loud young salesman who was typing “@here”&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Goodnight Github stars&lt;br>
Goodnight asserts&lt;br>
Good night pager duty alerts&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Tips for Working from Home</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/tips-for-working-from-home/</link><pubDate>Mon, 16 Mar 2020 08:04:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/tips-for-working-from-home/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/images/office_ping_pong_game_illustration.png" alt="Featured image of post Tips for Working from Home" />&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been working remotely for tech startups for six years, so I am sharing some tips for those working from home for the first time.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Start Working Early&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
If you can&amp;rsquo;t find someone to chat with for 30 minutes while making coffee, consider starting your workday instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Simulate Office Noise&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
If you miss the background noise of your office, try listening to 8 hours of power drill noises &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNu4cNgJ-Hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. For a more realistic ambiance, you can overlay it with the most annoying laugh ever &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9WcSaIAa5Ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Afternoon Activities&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Without a ping-pong table at home, you might find yourself with nothing to do but work in the afternoons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Familiarize Yourself with Remote Tools&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Programmers, take some time to get used to the essential tools for remote work, such as Jira, GitHub, Slack, and Zoom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engage in Local Politics&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
If the quarantine lasts longer than expected and you start to miss petty workplace politics, consider joining your local HOA.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol></description></item><item><title>My Tweets in the News</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/tweets-in-the-news/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jul 2019 13:40:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/tweets-in-the-news/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/images/computer-fishing.png" alt="Featured image of post My Tweets in the News" />&lt;p>A few weeks back, I was browsing Google Maps and noticed the word &amp;ldquo;DEMO&amp;rdquo;
written in faint green letters in rural South Sudan. A journalist came across
this tweet and &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48444703" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>wrote about it for
bbc.com&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote class="twitter-tweet">&lt;p lang="qme" dir="ltr">🤔 &lt;a href="https://t.co/TOJvHsxdD9">https://t.co/TOJvHsxdD9&lt;/a> &lt;a href="https://t.co/UtHG6Jpgxz">pic.twitter.com/UtHG6Jpgxz&lt;/a>&lt;/p>&amp;mdash; Tim Hopper (@tdhopper) &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/1133413170909982720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019&lt;/a>&lt;/blockquote> &lt;script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8">&lt;/script>
&lt;p>Way back in 2015, I tweeted &amp;ldquo;Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
Write a program to fish for him and you maintain it for a lifetime.&amp;rdquo; Today,
that tweet appeared in &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02046-0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>a nature.com article about the challenges of releasing
open source software&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>

Zen of Git
Ugly is better than beautiful.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Complex is better than simple.
Complicated is better than complex.
Flat is better than nested.
Readability is meaningless.
Special cases are everything.
Errors should never be comprehensible.
In the face of ambiguity, copy and paste from Stack Overflow.
There should be no obvious way to do it.
Although there may be endless non obvious ways to do it.
If the documentation is hard to understand, it's a great idea.
If the documentation is easy to understand, it's probably for another tool.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
