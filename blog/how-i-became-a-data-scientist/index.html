<time class=article-time--published>May 11, 2015</time></div></footer></div></header><section class=article-content><p>Caution: the following post is laden with qualitative extrapolation of
anecdotes and impressions. Perhaps ironically (though perhaps not), it is not
a data driven approach to measuring the efficacy of math majors as data
scientists. If you have a differing opinion, I would greatly appreciate you to
carefully articulate it and share it with the world.</p><p>I recently started my third &ldquo;real&rdquo; job since finishing school; at my first and
third jobs I have been a &ldquo;data scientist&rdquo;. I was a math major in college (and
pretty good at it) and spent a year in the math Ph.D. program at the
University of Virginia (and performed well there as well). These two facts
alone would not have equipped me for a career in data science. In fact, it
remains unclear to me that those two facts alone would have prepared me for
any career (with the possible exception of teaching) without significantly
more training.</p><h2 id=there-has-never-been-a-better-time-to-be-a-mathematician>&ldquo;There has never been a better time to be a mathematician&rdquo;?</h2><p>When I was in college <a class=link href=https://web.archive.org/web/20160315082911/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-01-22/math-will-rock-your-world target=_blank rel=noopener>Business Week published an article</a> declaring &ldquo;There has never been a better time to be a mathematician.&rdquo;
At the time, I saw an enormous disconnect between the piece and what I was
being taught in math classes (and thus what I considered to be a
&ldquo;mathematician&rdquo;). I have come across other pieces lauding this as the age of
the mathematicians, and more often than not, I&rsquo;ve wondered if the author knew
what students actually studied in math departments.</p><h3 id=background-on-me>Background on Me</h3><p>The math courses I had as an undergraduate were:</p><ul><li>Linear algebra</li><li>Discrete math</li><li>Differential equations (ODEs and numerical)</li><li>Theory of statistics 1</li><li>Numerical analysis 1 (numerical linear algebra) and 2 (quadrature)</li><li>Abstract algebra</li><li>Number theory</li><li>Real analysis</li><li>Complex analysis</li><li>Intermediate analysis (point set topology)</li></ul><p>My program also required a one semester intro to C++ and two semesters of
freshman physics. In my year as a math Ph.D. student, I took analysis,
algebra, and topology classes; had I stayed in the program, my future
coursework would have been similar: pure math where homework problems
consistent almost exclusively of proofs done with pen and paper (or in LaTeX).</p><h2 id=what-is-data-science>What is Data Science?</h2><p>Though my current position occasionally requires mathematical proof, I suspect
that is rare among data scientist. While the &ldquo;data science&rdquo; demarcation
problem is challenging (and I will not seek to solve it here), it seems
evident that my curriculum lacked preparation in many essential areas of data
science. Chief among these are programming skill, knowledge of experimental
statistics, and experience with math modeling.</p><h3 id=data-science-requires-programming-and-engineering>Data Science Requires Programming and Engineering</h3><p>Few would argue that programming ability is not a key skill of data science.
As Drew Conway <a class=link href=http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram target=_blank rel=noopener>has argued</a>, a data scientist need not have a degree in computer
science, but &ldquo;Being able to manipulate text files at the command-line,
understanding vectorized operations, thinking algorithmically; these are the
hacking skills that make for a successful data hacker.&rdquo; Many of my undergrad
peers, having briefly seen C++ freshman year and occasionally used Mathematica
to solve ODEs for homework assignments, would have been unaware that
manipulation of a file from the command-line was even possible, much less have
been able to write a simple sed script; there was little difference with my
grad school classmates.</p><p>Many data science positions require even more than the ability to solve
problems with code. As <a class=link href=http://treycausey.com/software_dev_skills.html target=_blank rel=noopener>Trey Causey has recently
explained</a>, many positions
require understanding of <em>software engineering</em> skills and tools such as
writing reusable code, using version control, software testing, and logging.
Though I gained a fair bit of programming skill in college, these skills, now
essential in my daily work, remained foreign to me until years later.</p><h3 id=data-science-requires-applied-statistics>Data Science Requires Applied Statistics</h3><p>My math training had a lack of statistics courses. Though my brief exposure to
mathematical statistics has been valuable in picking up machine learning,
experimental statistics was missing altogether. Many data science teams are
interested in questions of causal inference and design and analysis of
experiments; some would make these <em>essential</em> skills for a data scientist. I
learned nothing about these topics in math departments. Moreover, machine
learning, also a cornerstone of data science, is not a subject I could have
even defined until after I was finished with my math coursework; at the end of
college, I would have said artificial intelligence was mostly about rule-based
systems in Lisp and Prolog.</p><h3 id=data-science-involves-_very-applied-math_>Data Science Involves <em>Very Applied Math</em></h3><p>Even if statistics had play a more prominent role in my coursework, those who
have studied statistics know there is often a gulf between understanding
textbook statistics and being able to effectively apply statistical models and
methods to real world problems. This is only an aspect of a bigger issue:
mathematical (including statistical) modeling is an extraordinarily
challenging problem, but instruction on effectively model real world problems
is absent from many math programs. To this day, defining my problem in
mathematical terms one of the hardest problems I face; I am certain that I am
not alone on this. Though I am now armed with a wide variety of mathematical
models, it is rarely clear exactly which model can or should be applied in a
given situation.</p><p>I suspect that many people, even technical people, are uncertain as to what
academic math is beyond undergraduate calculus. Mathematicians mostly work in
the logical manipulation of abstractly defined structures. These structures
rarely bear any necessary relationship to physical entities or data sets
outside the abstractly defined domain of discourse. Though some might argue I
am speaking only of &ldquo;pure&rdquo; mathematics, this is often true of what is formally
known as &ldquo;applied mathematics&rdquo;. <a class=link href=http://www.johndcook.com/veryappliedmath.html target=_blank rel=noopener>John D. Cook has made similar
observations</a> about the
limitations of pure and applied math (as proper disciplines) in dubbing
himself a &ldquo;very applied mathematician&rdquo;. Very applied mathematics is &ldquo;an
interest in the grubby work required to see the math actually used and a
willingness to carry it out. This involves not just math but also computing,
consulting, managing, marketing, etc.&rdquo; These skills are conspicuously absent
from most math curricula I am familiar with.</p><h2 id=math--data-science>Math ‚Üí Data Science</h2><p>Given this description of how my schooling left me woefully unprepared for a
career in data science, one might ask how I have had two jobs with that title.
I can think of several (though probably not all) reasons.</p><p><strong>First, the academic study of mathematics provides much of the theoretical
underpinnings of data science.</strong> Mathematics underlies the study of machine
learning, statistics, optimization, data structures, analysis of algorithms,
computer architecture, and other important aspects of data science. Knowledge
of mathematics (potentially) allows the learner to more quickly grasp each of
these fields. For example, learning how <a class=link href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis target=_blank rel=noopener>principle component
analysis</a>‚Äîa math
model that can be applied and interpreted by someone without formal
mathematical training‚Äîworks will be significantly easier for someone with
earlier exposure linear algebra. On a meta-level, training in mathematics
forces students to think carefully and solve hard problems; these skills are
valuable in many fields, including data science.</p><p><strong>My second reason is connect to the first: I unwittingly took a number of
courses that later played important roles in my data science toolkit.</strong> For
example, my current work in Bayesian inference has been made possible by my
knowledge of linear algebra, numerical analysis, stochastic processes, measure
theory, and mathematical statistics.</p><p><strong>Third, I did a minor in computer science as an undergraduate.</strong> That
provided a solid foundation for me when I decided to get serious about
building programming skill in 2010. Though my academic exposure to computer
science lacked any software engineer skills, I left college with a solid grasp
of basic data structures, analysis of algorithms, complexity theory, and a
handful of programming languages.</p><p><strong>Fourth, I did a masters degree in operations research (after my year as a
math PhD student convinced me pure math wasn&rsquo;t for me).</strong> This provided me
with experience in math modeling, a broad knowledge of mathematical
optimization (central to machine learning), and the opportunity to take
graduate-level machine learning classes.<sup id=fnref:1><a href=#fn:1 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>1</a></sup></p><p><strong>Fifth, my insatiable curiosity in computers and problem solving has played a
key role in my career success.</strong> Eager to learn something about computer
programming, I taught myself PHP and SQL as a high school student (to make
Tolkien fan sites, incidentally). Having been given small Mathematica-based
homework assignments in freshman differential equations, I bought and read a
book on programming Mathematica. Throughout college and grad school, I often
tried‚Äîand sometimes succeeded‚Äîto write programs to solve homework problems
that professors expected to be solved by hand. This curiosity has proven
valuable time and time again as I&rsquo;ve been required to learn new skills and
solve technical problems of all varieties. I&rsquo;m comfortable jumping in to solve
a new problem at work, because I&rsquo;ve been doing that on my own time for fifteen
years.</p><p><strong>Sixth, I have been been fortunate enough to have employers who have
patiently taught me and given me the freedom to learn on my own.</strong> I have
learned an enormous amount in my two and a half year professional career, and
I don&rsquo;t anticipate slowing down any time soon. As <a class=link href=https://twitter.com/mat_kelcey/status/328179275893207042 target=_blank rel=noopener>Mat
Kelcey</a> has said:
always be sure you&rsquo;re not the smartest one in the room. I am very thankful for
three jobs where I&rsquo;ve been surrounded by smart people who have taught me a
lot, and for supervisors who trust me enough to let me learn on my own.</p><p><strong>Finally,<sup id=fnref:2><a href=#fn:2 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>2</a></sup> it would be hard for me to overvalue the four and a half years of
participation in the data science community on Twitter.</strong> Through Twitter, I
have the ear of some of data science&rsquo;s brightest minds (most of whom I&rsquo;ve
never met in person), and I&rsquo;ve built a peer network that has helped me find my
current and last job. However, I mostly want to emphasize the pedagogical
value of Twitter. Every day, I&rsquo;m updated on the release of new software tools
for data science, the best new blog posts for our field, and the musings of of
some of my data science heros. Of course, I don&rsquo;t read every blog post or
learn every software tool. But Twitter helps me to recognize which posts are
most worth my time, and because of Twitter, I know <em>something</em> instead of
<em>nothing</em> about Theano, Scalding, and dplyr.<sup id=fnref:3><a href=#fn:3 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>3</a></sup></p><h2 id=conclusions>Conclusions</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t know to what extent my experience generalizes<sup id=fnref:4><a href=#fn:4 class=footnote-ref role=doc-noteref>4</a></sup>, in either the
limitations of my education or my analysis of my success, but I am obviously
not going to let that stop me from drawing some general conclusions.</p><h3 id=hiring-data-scientists>Hiring Data Scientists</h3><p>For those hiring data scientists, recognize that mathematics as taught might
not be the same mathematics you need from your team. Plenty of people with
PhDs in mathematics would be unable to define linear regression or bloom
filters. At the same time, recognize that math majors are taught to think well
and solve hard problems; these skills shouldn&rsquo;t be undervalued. Math majors
are also experienced in reading and learning math! They may be able to read
academic papers and understand difficult (even if new) mathematical more
quickly than a computer scientist or social scientist. Given enough practice
and training, they would probably be excellent programmers.</p><h3 id=studying-math>Studying Math</h3><p>For those studying math, recognize that the field you love, in its formal
sense, may be keeping you away from enjoyable and lucrative careers. Most of
your math professors have spent their adult lives solving math problems on
paper or on a chalkboard. They are inexperienced and, possibly,
unknowledgeable about <em>very applied mathematics</em>. A successful career in pure
mathematics will be very hard and will require you to be very good. While
there seem to be lots of jobs in teaching, they will rarely pay well.</p><p>If you&rsquo;re still an student, you have a great opportunity to take control of
your career path. Consider taking computer science classes (e.g. data
structures, algorithms, software engineering, machine learning) and statistics
classes (e.g. experimental design, data analysis, data mining).</p><p>For both students and graduates, recognize your math knowledge becomes very
marketable when combined skills such as programming and machine learning;
there are a wealth of good books, MOOCs, and blog posts that can help you
learn these things. More over, the barrier to entry for getting started with
production quality tools has never been lower. Don&rsquo;t let your coursework be
the extent of your education.
