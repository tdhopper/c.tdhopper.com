<time class=article-time--published>Mar 05, 2018</time></div></footer></div></header><section class=article-content><p><a class=link href=/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/>Three years ago</a>, I
wrote a post called &ldquo;How I Became a Data Scientist Despite Being a Math
Major&rdquo;.</p><p>When I wrote the post, I thought I was explaining that that was about all I
know about how someone can become a data scientist: that is, I shared my
subjective experience. I intended to communicate my uncertainty about the path
others should take. But, given the number of people who have read the post and
emailed asking for my advice on becoming a data scientist, that message wasn&rsquo;t
clear. With most of these emails, I have felt bad because I simply don&rsquo;t know
the answers to the questions people have. But because so many people seem to
have these questions, I decided to consolidate my uncertainty here. I hope you
find it helpful.</p><p>A note before the Q&amp;A: one reason it is so hard to advise someone on becoming
a &ldquo;data scientist&rdquo; is that &ldquo;data scientist&rdquo; is an ill-defined job title. At
some companies, data scientists are building machine learning models and
running them in a high performance production system. At other data companies,
data scientists are business analysts running SQL queries and visualizing the
results with Tableau. Some data scientist are doing complex experimental
design while others are mostly moving files around S3 buckets. Some data
science roles require deep domain expertise, others only need some programming
skill and knowledge of Scikit-Learn. As you shape your own path to data
science, take some time to think specifically about the kind of work you are
interested in doing; this will shape your preparation.</p><h2 id=should-i-get-a-masters-degree>Should I get a masters degree?</h2><p>My sense is that a good masters degree in a technical field is a valuable
degree. It takes a fraction of the time a Ph.D. takes, yet you can learn a lot
in 3 or 4 semesters of coursework, and the degree is viewed favoribly by
employers. The quality and curriculum of masters programs varies wildly, so
you&rsquo;ll want to do your due diligence before diving in.</p><p>That said, I&rsquo;m wary of people going into deep debt for a masters degree. If
you can get a teaching or research position that waives your tuition, do it.
Consider going a <em>good</em> school on in-state tuition instead of a <em>great</em> school
for $100,000. If you have publicly subsidized graduate education (as in many
European countries), go for it!</p><h2 id=will-a-masters-degree-help-me-becomebe-a-data-scientist>Will a masters degree help me become/be a data scientist?</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t know, but it has helped me. As I said in <a class=link href=/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/>my earlier
post</a>, I learned a
lot about algorithms, probability models, math, and machine learning that has
been invaluable. Grad school also gave me the time and inspiration to learn R
and Python which have played important roles in my career?</p><h2 id=should-i-get-a-masters-degree-in-computer-science-will-it-help-me-become-a-data-scientist>Should I get a masters degree in computer science? Will it help me become a data scientist?</h2><p>I think a masters degree in computer science will be likely to pay off in the
long run. It may not help you get a job as a data scientist, but it would
undoubtedly help you in a data science job.</p><p>I have half of a computer science masters, and I sometimes wish I had finished
it.</p><h2 id=should-i-get-a-masters-degree-in-operations-research>Should I get a masters degree in operations research?</h2><p>I&rsquo;m ambivalent about operations research. As a discipline, operations research
has been in an identity crisis. As a curriculum, many operations research
programs are full of content valuable for data scientists. As a signal to
potential employers, operations research is relatively unknown and won&rsquo;t mean
as much as a degree in &ldquo;machine learning&rdquo; or similar.</p><h2 id=did-you-feel-that-operations-research-was-too-theoretical-and-that-you-had-to-hustle-outside-the-classroom-and-build-statml-skills-separately>Did you feel that operations research was too theoretical and that you had to hustle outside the classroom and build stat/ML skills separately?</h2><p>Operations research programs have wildly different curriculums. Mine didn&rsquo;t do
a great job preparing me for real-world applications, but that might be better
learned on the job anyway. My program allowed me to build statistics and ML
expertise only because I had flexibility in the courses I could select; I was
able to take a handful of stats/ML related classes. Other programs might not
offer that.</p><h2 id=should-i-get-a-masters-degree-in-statistics>Should I get a masters degree in statistics?</h2><p>If you have strong programming/software engineering skills (or have another
means of building them), a statistics degree could be valuable; as with
anything, I&rsquo;m sure the quality of statistics masters degrees varies greatly,
and it&rsquo;s worth trying to find a good one.</p><h2 id=should-i-get-a-phd>Should I get a Ph.D.?</h2><p><a class=link href=https://mobile.twitter.com/shouldyougetphd target=_blank rel=noopener>I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s worth it for most
people.</a> It&rsquo;s also not necessary
for the vast majority of data science jobs. <a class=link href=https://shouldigetaphd.com target=_blank rel=noopener>I have a dedicated website to
help you answer this question.</a></p><p>There are a lot of people with Ph.D.&rsquo;s in data science roles. It&rsquo;s possible
that is more a result of the large difference in the number Ph.D.&rsquo;s verses the
small number of permanent faculty positions in American universities. People
with Ph.D.&rsquo;s need jobs; many have skills overlapping with data science; they
make their way from academia to data science.</p><h2 id=can-i-become-a-data-scientist-with-only-an-undergraduate-degree>Can I become a data scientist with only an undergraduate degree?</h2><p>Many others have. I have known several who don&rsquo;t even have college degrees.</p><h2 id=im-in-school-should-i-take-x-class>I&rsquo;m in school should I take X class?</h2><p>If it&rsquo;s linear algebra, definitely. Otherwise, I&rsquo;m not sure. Among other
reasons, I&rsquo;ve been often surprised how classes I never expected to apply have
helped me years later; it&rsquo;s hard for me to know what other classes would&rsquo;ve
helped me had I taken them.</p><p>Take the best professors you can (note I didn&rsquo;t say <em>easiest</em> ). Talk to older
students you admire about different classes and professors. Don&rsquo;t let your
schooling interfere with your education.</p><h2 id=can-you-evaluate-my-qualifications-for-being-a-data-scientist>Can you evaluate my qualifications for being a data scientist?</h2><p>Not very well. In fact, <a class=link href=/blog/some-reflections-on-being-turned-down-for-a-lot-of-data-science-jobs/>I think it&rsquo;s pretty challenging</a> even for people who interview data science
candidates. <a class=link href=/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/>I have tried to share the things that helped qualify
me</a>, and I imagine
those things would be valuable for you as well.</p><p>I would suggest trying to evaluate your qualifications against specific jobs
(or job descriptions) you are interested in. Are you more interested in
<a class=link href=https://medium.com/@rchang/my-two-year-journey-as-a-data-scientist-at-twitter-f0c13298aee6 target=_blank rel=noopener>analysis or production systems</a>? Are you interested
cybersecurity applications? Ad markets? Social good? Journalism? Finance?
Healthcare? Self-driving cars? Find job postings for roles and look at the
qualifications. Find people in these roles on Linkedin and look at their
qualifications and job history.</p><p>One other note: just because you&rsquo;re qualified, doesn&rsquo;t mean you will get job
offers. Not getting an offer after interviewing <em>might</em> reflect more on poor
interviewers than being a poor candidate.</p><h2 id=how-do-i-show-on-my-resumedemonstrate-to-employers-that-i-am-qualified-to-be-a-data-scientist>How do I show-on-my-resume/demonstrate-to-employers that I am qualified to be a data scientist?</h2><p>My best advice is to work on interesting and relevant things and <a class=link href=https://youtu.be/uRul8QdYvqQ target=_blank rel=noopener>tell people
about them</a>. I don&rsquo;t know how to be more
specific.</p><h2 id=how-can-i-get-a-job-where-i-can-do-more-applied-math>How can I get a job where I can do more applied math?</h2><p>Even in data science jobs, a lot of the work is far removed from interesting
math. My hypothesis is that relatively few people get to spend a substantial
part of their job thinking about interesting math. I&rsquo;ve
<a class=link href=https://github.com/datamicroscopes/lda/graphs/contributors target=_blank rel=noopener>almost</a> never
gotten to spend as much time doing math as <a class=link href=https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/684380622639333376 target=_blank rel=noopener>I would
like</a>.</p><h2 id=what-skills-would-you-recommend-i-develop-if-i-hope-to-become-a-data-scientist>What skills would you recommend I develop if I hope to become a data scientist?</h2><p>You can never be a good enough writer, communicator, software engineer, linear
algebraist, or applied statistician. Tenacity is important too, though I&rsquo;m not
sure how you develop it.</p><h2 id=am-i-doing-the-right-things-to-build-a-successful-career-in-data-science>Am I doing the right things to build a successful career in data science?</h2><p>I don&rsquo;t know the answer to that question. I have tried to share the things
that have been valuable for me in the preceding answer and <a class=link href=/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/>in my blog
post</a>.</p><h2 id=im-in-a-career-as-a-teacherdeveloperanalystetc-can-you-advise-me-on-how-i-can-transition-to-be-a-data-scientist>I&rsquo;m in a career as a teacher/developer/analyst/etc. Can you advise me on how I can transition to be a data scientist?</h2><p>I have tried <a class=link href=/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/>to share the things that worked for
me</a>; you might be
