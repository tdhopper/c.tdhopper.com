After a year as a CS major, I realized I loved the theory classes but didn&amp;rsquo;t care as much about the practical and programming portions of the curriculum. Going into my junior year, I switched—for the last time—to major in math.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>During the winter of my junior year, I applied to a bunch of math &lt;a class="link" href="https://new.nsf.gov/funding/opportunities/reu-research-experiences-undergraduates" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Research Experience for Undergraduates&lt;/a> programs at schools around the country. I was thrilled to be accepted to the program at Rochester Institute of Technology organized by &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.rit.edu/science/directory/dansma-darren-narayan" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Darren Narayan&lt;/a> for the summer of 2007.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I headed to Rochester starry eyed about spending the summer doing math research. On my first day, I found out I&amp;rsquo;d be working with the inimitable mathematician &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stanis%C5%82aw_Radziszowski" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stanisław P. Radziszowski&lt;/a> on computational combinatorics with &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/evanheidtmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>another student researcher&lt;/a>, Evan Heidtmann. The first question Dr. Radziszowski had for us was &amp;ldquo;How are your programming skills?&amp;rdquo; This was not what I expected&amp;ndash;or wanted&amp;ndash;to hear at a math research program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We spent the summer investigating the &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ramsey%27s_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ramsey number&lt;/a> $R_4(C_4)$. This is the smallest number $n$ such that a &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete_graph" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>complete graph&lt;/a> with $n$ vertices where the edges are colored by four colors is &lt;em>guaranteed&lt;/em> to have a monochromatic cycle with 4 vertices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the time, the number was known to be either 18 or 19. Due to combinatorial explosion, it&amp;rsquo;s not possible to enumerate every graph 4-coloring for graphs of this size. A graph with 18 vertices has 153 edges which could be colored in $4^{153}$ ways (ignoring isomorphisms). This is a very, very big number.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since the number was one of two options, one way to prove it had to be 19 would be to find a complete graph with 18 vertices where the edges are colored by four colors while not containing a 4-cycle subgraph in one color. Evan and I spent the summer hunting for this mythical graph coloring by writing C code to generate and check graphs.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before showing up in Rochester, I had no experience writing C code. Fortunately, my brilliant and patient research partner Evan did, and he quickly got me up to speed enough to manipulate and generate graphs using &lt;a class="link" href="https://users.cecs.anu.edu.au/bdm/nauty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>nauty&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had also never used version control, but Evan was running a version control (I don&amp;rsquo;t recall which one) platform on his home server, so we were able to easily version and collaborate on our code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We also had access to fifty Unix machines in the RIT computing lab, so this summer introduced me to the Unix command line, shell scripting, and distributed computing. I wrote bash scripts that would send our processing jobs out to these machines and aggregate results back to a host node.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Well, we failed to solve our problem. It turns out the solution was actually &lt;a class="link" href="https://utilitasmathematica.com/index.php/Index/article/view/481" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>published by Chinese mathematicians&lt;/a> while we were working on it. $R_4(C_4)=18$, so the graph we looked for didn&amp;rsquo;t even exist.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Nonetheless, that experience ended up being one of the most important of my higher education. I learned some of the most fundamental skills of my career (version control, working in terminal, writing fast code, and persevering through computer challenges), and I learned to enjoy writing code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I didn&amp;rsquo;t write much code between 2007 and starting my operations research master&amp;rsquo;s degree research in 2011, but when I started again, the skills and tenacity I developed at that REU set me up for success in grad school and joining industry as a data scientist in 2012. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have picked that research project had I been given a choice; I&amp;rsquo;m so glad I wasn&amp;rsquo;t asked.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>AI Assisted Programming with Ravi Mody</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/ai-assisted-programming-with-ravi-mody/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Sep 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/ai-assisted-programming-with-ravi-mody/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/images/robot-assistant.png" alt="Featured image of post AI Assisted Programming with Ravi Mody" />&lt;h2 id="listen">Listen

At a minimum, people come to me for things because they know I get things done. This doesn&amp;rsquo;t come naturally to me, and it&amp;rsquo;s a skill I&amp;rsquo;ve developed over the past 15 years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here are some of the things I do to be productive:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="write-things-down">Write things down
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I loosely follow the &lt;a class="link" href="https://getdrafts.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Getting Things Done&lt;/a> method developed by David Allen. The most important aspect to me has been capturing tasks into a single inbox. Capturing tasks means I don&amp;rsquo;t try to keep them in my head (which is unreliable and burns a lot of brain power trying to remember things). Capturing to a single inbox means tasks won&amp;rsquo;t get lost in piles of Post-Its and napkins.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use the &lt;a class="link" href="https://getdrafts.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Drafts&lt;/a> app on iOS and macOS, which lets me capture notes with zero friction. If it&amp;rsquo;s a task I&amp;rsquo;m writing down, I use a Drafts action to send it to my &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Omnifocus&lt;/a> inbox. I regularly triage my inbox to organize my tasks into relevant projects and contexts (e.g., tasks that can be done on the computer and tasks to do at home).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="using-nagging-reminders">Using nagging reminders
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Tasks that &lt;em>must&lt;/em> be done at a certain time aren&amp;rsquo;t fit for my Omnifocus task management systems. For example, my trash must go out on Monday nights, and I need to be reminded until it happens. I love the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.dueapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Due app&lt;/a> on iOS, which will remind me repeatedly until the task is complete.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="tame-email">Tame email
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I keep my email tidy. A big part of this is using &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.sanebox.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Sanebox&lt;/a> to keep unimportant emails out of my inbox; Sanebox automatically detects, labels, and archives inbox clutter like receipts, marketing, and newsletters. These typically don&amp;rsquo;t require any action and can be triaged as necessary. I aggressively hit the &amp;ldquo;Unsubscribe&amp;rdquo; button on things I don&amp;rsquo;t need to be bothered with (including most marketing).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When an email can be handled quickly (within a minute or two), I try to handle it as soon as I receive it. If an email requires work to follow up on, I forward it to my &lt;a class="link" href="" >Omnifocus&lt;/a> inbox and make it a task.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When this works well, my email inbox is normally empty.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="forget-passwords">Forget passwords
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I have hundreds (thousands?) of logins to websites and apps. Even if I could use the same password for all of them, this is a notorious security risk.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every password I use lives in my &lt;a class="link" href="https://1password.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>1Password&lt;/a> account. I also use it to manage 2-factor authentication pins, credit cards, WiFi passwords, and personal information (social security numbers, driver&amp;rsquo;s license scans, etc.). Using the 1Password keyboard shortcuts, I can quickly log in to any of my accounts.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I know my 1Password master passwords and almost no other passwords to my accounts. They&amp;rsquo;re typically long, randomly generated mixtures of characters.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>1Password also lets me have a shared vault with my wife, which is invaluable for our shared services.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="keep-slack-under-control">Keep Slack under control
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Like many tech workers, much of my day is spent in Slack. A few years ago, I stumbled upon &lt;a class="link" href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-i-slack-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Michael Lopp&amp;rsquo;s guide to optimizing Slack&lt;/a>. His approach greatly improved my experience with Slack and kept it from being a constant distraction. &lt;a class="link" href="https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-i-slack-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Go read his post.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dont-waste-15-minutes">Don&amp;rsquo;t waste 15 minutes
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Like the next guy, I&amp;rsquo;m often inclined to spend 15 minutes of downtime scrolling Instagram. However, I once heard advice from a productive person that a key to productivity is not wasting those short intervals.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I have free minutes (sitting in a waiting room or during a short interval between meetings), I look for a task I can knock off my to-do list. I&amp;rsquo;m regularly surprised that daunting tasks can be finished in little time.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="dont-waste-idle-brain-cycles">Don&amp;rsquo;t waste idle brain cycles
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Some tasks (like writing this blog post) are hard to complete in one sitting. I have difficulty developing new ideas in front of my computer with all its distractions. On the other hand, I&amp;rsquo;m a &lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/blog/on-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>strong believer in the power of noodling on ideas&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When developing ideas, I prime my brain by dumping my thoughts on the topic into a Drafts app note and then thinking about it as I go about my day. When I have things to add, I pull up the note and jot down my ideas.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Good programming languages are nice but not vital</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/good-programming-languages-are-nice-but-not-vital/</link><pubDate>Wed, 03 Apr 2024 11:46:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/good-programming-languages-are-nice-but-not-vital/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/images/complaining.png" alt="Featured image of post Good programming languages are nice but not vital" />&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>When someone says, “I want a programming language in which I need only say what I wish done,” give him a lollipop. (Alan Perlis, &lt;a class="link" href="https://cpsc.yale.edu/epigrams-programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>People love to talk trash about programming languages on Twitter. Every day there&amp;rsquo;s a new viral tweet &lt;a class="link" href="https://x.com/holdenmatt/status/1774866242282672365?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Python&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have worked with many programming languages and studied others in school, but I&amp;rsquo;ve spent most of the last ten years deep into Python. Of course, Python has warts and wrinkles; I&amp;rsquo;m intimately familiar with many of them! At the same time, people worldwide effectively use Python to solve all kinds of problems. As it turns out, many common frustrations can be set aside with a little effort (e.g., by integrating modern tooling like &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ruff&lt;/a>).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m regularly convinced that Brian Kernighan knew everything there is to know about software engineering practice, and he wrote it down before I was born in 1986. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t miss the mark in his &lt;a class="link" href="https://archive.org/details/programming-style" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>1979 paper with Plauger&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;many people try to excuse badly written programs by blaming inadequacies of the language that must be used. We have seen repeatedly that even Fortran can be tamed with proper discipline. The presence of bad features is not an invitation to use them, nor is the absence of good features an excuse to avoid simulating them as cleanly as possible. Good languages are nice, but not vital.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>People forget that two of the top three most visited websites (Youtube and Facebook) were originally implemented in PHP, a language rarely considered a Platonic ideal.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++, says, &amp;ldquo;There are only two kinds of languages: the ones people complain about and the ones nobody uses.&amp;rdquo; He&amp;rsquo;s right, and I&amp;rsquo;m guessing we&amp;rsquo;ll never move entirely beyond that (even as language improvement continues). I, for one, am willing to embrace this and learn to do the best with the tools we have.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Announcing the Python Developer Tooling Handbook</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/announcing-the-python-developer-tooling-handbook/</link><pubDate>Sat, 10 Feb 2024 16:31:16 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/announcing-the-python-developer-tooling-handbook/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/images/pydevtools-announcement.png" alt="Featured image of post Announcing the Python Developer Tooling Handbook" />&lt;p>I’ve been a professional Python developer for over a decade. Like many Python developers, I’ve faced the many challenges of Python packaging and dependency management. I’ve also come to love helping developers find the right tools to make their work easier and more productive.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m excited to announce that I&amp;rsquo;m writing the &lt;a class="link" href="https://pydevtools.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Python Developer Tooling Handbook&lt;/a>, a free
ebook on Python developer tooling. This handbook covers a wide range of topics,

&lt;p>When I&amp;rsquo;m trying to develop new ideas, sitting at my desk staring at my computer (and all the world&amp;rsquo;s distractions) seems to be the worst place. Instead, I like to prime my mind by writing down whatever thoughts I have on the topic and then trying to ruminate as I go about life.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m inspired by stories of brilliant people coming up with ideas at surprising times:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="http://garfield.library.upenn.edu/classics1981/A1981MS54100001.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hirotugu Akaike said&lt;/a> the idea for his eponymous &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akaike_information_criterion" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Akaike Information Criterion&lt;/a> while taking his seat on the bus.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Grant Wood, most famous for painting American Gothic, once said &amp;ldquo;All the really good ideas I&amp;rsquo;ve ever had came to me while I was milking a cow.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://permalink.lanl.gov/object/tr?what=info:lanl-repo/lareport/LA-UR-88-9068" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stanisław Ulam, a key physicist in the Manhattan Project, recounted how he thought&lt;/a> of Monte Carlo methods while home sick and playing solitaire. (Monte Carlo methods essential in modern artificial intelligence model training!)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/10.1142/9789814434430_0002" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Paul Dirac, a founder of quantum mechanics, said,&lt;/a> &amp;ldquo;I would like to mention that I found the best ideas usually came, not when one was actively striving for them, but when one was in a more relaxed state.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Of course, this method can be abused. I had a classmate in grad school who used to use &amp;ldquo;you can&amp;rsquo;t force inspiration&amp;rdquo; as an excuse to never do any work. I try to balance these anecdotes with Stephen King&amp;rsquo;s proverb: &amp;ldquo;Amateurs sit and wait for inspiration, the rest of us just get up and go to work.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>No Silver Bullet</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/no-silver-bullet/</link><pubDate>Fri, 18 Nov 2022 20:15:17 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/no-silver-bullet/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/silver_bullet.png" alt="Featured image of post No Silver Bullet" />&lt;p>In 1986, Fred Brooks published &amp;ldquo;No Silver Bullet—Essence and Accident in Software Engineering&amp;rdquo; where he argues that there is no silver bullet that &amp;ldquo;to make software costs drop as rapidly as computer hardware costs do&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Software progress doesn&amp;rsquo;t follow Moore&amp;rsquo;s Law.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Managers characterize software projects as &amp;ldquo;usually innocent and straightforward, but&amp;hellip; capable of becoming a monster of missed schedules, blown budgets, and flawed products.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ouch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The beginning of hope [in creating software], however, is realizing &amp;ldquo;that progress would be made stepwise, at great effort, and that a persistent, unremitting care.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Software&amp;rsquo;s difficulty has two aspects &amp;ldquo;essence, the difficulties inherent in the nature of software, and accidents, those difficulties that today attend its production but are not inherent.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>⚠️Brooks&amp;rsquo; central thesis:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I ʙᴇʟɪᴇᴠᴇ ᴛʜᴇ ʜᴀʀᴅ ᴘᴀʀᴛ ᴏғ ʙᴜɪʟᴅɪɴɢ sᴏғᴛᴡᴀʀᴇ to be the specification, design, and testing of this conceptual construct, not the labor of representing it and testing the fidelity of the representation.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>▶ Essential challenges of software have 4 aspects: complexity, conformity, changeability, and invisibility.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Complexity: &amp;ldquo;Software entities are more complex for their size than perhaps any other human construct because no two parts are alike.&amp;rdquo; Because complexity is essential to software, in trying to abstract away complexity, you &amp;ldquo;often abstract away its essence.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Conformity: Our software is often forced to conform to other interfaces (perhaps because it comes after hardware, or perhaps simply because its &amp;ldquo;perceived as the most conformable&amp;rdquo;). &amp;ldquo;This complexity cannot be simplified out by any redesign of the software alone.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Changeability: &amp;ldquo;Aʟʟ sᴜᴄᴄᴇssғᴜʟ sᴏғᴛᴡᴀʀᴇ ɢᴇᴛs ᴄʜᴀɴɢᴇᴅ.&amp;rdquo; When software succeeds, people push the boundaries of what it was designed for. And the physical world around software changes, so software must adapted (e.g. a new model of hardware is released).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Invisibility: &amp;ldquo;The reality of software is not inherently embedded in space.&amp;rdquo; Representations like directed graphs generally prove inadequate for fully representing software.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Progress has been made in removing 𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑖𝑑𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑙 difficulties of software:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>High-level languages&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Time sharing systems&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Unified programming environments&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Brooks saw other things coming that could improve software building, but he
was skeptical about how monumental they would be: artificial intelligence,
graphical programming, better code editors (e.g. language specific features),
faster workstations.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some means of attacking the 𝑒𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑖𝑎𝑙 complexity&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Buy vs. build: &amp;ldquo;The cost of software has always been development cost, not
replication cost.&amp;rdquo; Thus, if we 𝑐𝑎𝑛 buy it, we probably should.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Requirements refinement and rapid prototyping: &amp;ldquo;Tʜᴇ ʜᴀʀᴅᴇsᴛ sɪɴɢʟᴇ ᴘᴀʀᴛ ᴏғ
ʙᴜɪʟᴅɪɴɢ ᴀ sᴏғᴛᴡᴀʀᴇ sʏsᴛᴇᴍ ɪs ᴅᴇᴄɪᴅɪɴɢ ᴘʀᴇᴄɪsᴇʟʏ ᴡʜᴀᴛ ᴛᴏ ʙᴜɪʟᴅ.&amp;rdquo; &amp;ldquo;Therefore,
the most important function that the software builder performs for the client
is the 𝑖𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑣𝑒 𝑒𝑥𝑡𝑟𝑎𝑐𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛 𝑎𝑛𝑑 𝑟𝑒𝑓𝑖𝑛𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑜𝑓 𝑡ℎ𝑒 𝑝𝑟𝑜𝑑𝑢𝑐𝑡 𝑟𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑟𝑒𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Brooks again:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I would go a step further and assert that it is really impossible for a
client, even working with a software engineer, to specify completely,
precisely, and correctly the exact requirements of a modern software product
before trying some versions of the product.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>To serve iterative requirements gathering, a goal should be getting something
working as quickly as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(A side benefit of this is it improves morale for developers. &amp;ldquo;Enthusiasm
jumps when there is a running system, even a simple one.&amp;rdquo;)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Great software design comes from great designers. Software is a creative
process. &amp;ldquo;Sound methodology can empower and liberate the creative mind; it
cannot inflame or inspire the drudge.&amp;rdquo; Organizations would do well to focus on
identifying great software designers and working hard to &amp;ldquo;grow great
designers&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Brooks:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Skepticism is not pessimism, however. &amp;hellip; A disciplined, consistent effort to
develop, propagate, and exploit these innovations should indeed yield an
order-of-magnitude improvement. There is no royal road, but there is a road.&lt;/p>

develop guidelines for code review. Many teams require &amp;ldquo;code review&amp;rdquo; without
putting any effort into establishing a common understanding of what that
means. This post is adapted from proposed guidelines I prepared for one of my
teams. Of course, you don&amp;rsquo;t have to adopt &lt;em>my&lt;/em> guidelines for review, but I
would encourage your team to set aside some time to make sure you all mean the
same thing by &amp;ldquo;code review&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-a-code-review-for">What is a code review for?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Code review has multiple benefits and objectives including:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Code correctness&lt;/strong> : someone seeing your code with fresh eyes may help uncover bugs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Code familiarity&lt;/strong> : reading one another&amp;rsquo;s code keeps everyone familiar with the codebase.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Design feedback&lt;/strong> : a constantly evolving code base is a fight against complexity; reviewers can guide one another on keeping the codebase coherent and maintainable.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Mutual learning&lt;/strong> : the reviewer and author will inevitably learn from one another.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Regression protection&lt;/strong> : future contributors to the code base have checks against breaking essential functionality; importantly, &lt;em>this reduces fear of making necessary improvements to the code&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="what-code-reviews-arent">What code reviews aren&amp;rsquo;t
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>An opportunity for the reviewer to impose their idiosyncrasies.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>An opportunity for the developer to push off responsibility (e.g. correctness) for their code to the reviewer.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>An opportunity to demand perfection (Per &lt;a class="link" href="https://google.github.io/eng-practices/review/reviewer/standard.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Google’s Code Review Guidelines&lt;/a>: &lt;em>A key point here is that there is no such thing as &amp;ldquo;perfect&amp;rdquo; code—there is only better code&lt;/em> ).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="opening-pull-requests">Opening Pull Requests
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Take care to write informative commit messages. This helps your reviewer understand the decisions you made.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Consider your contribution in the broader context of the code base. Do you need to take extra steps to make the code healthier and manage complexity?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Keep pull requests short whenever possible. &lt;code>git --shortstat origin/main&lt;/code> will show you the size of your branch &amp;rsquo;s diff from main; under 400 lines changed is a great goal.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Write a pull request description that sets your reviewer up for success by helping them understand what the PR intends to accomplish.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>If you have a particularly complex PR, consider doing a code walk-through with a reviewer first.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>New code should ordinarily come with new tests.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="reviewing-pull-requests">Reviewing Pull Requests
&lt;/h2>&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Have a positive, constructive, helpful attitude.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Wait for continuous integration tasks to complete. Let the author resolve any test failures before beginning your review.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>As much as possible, configure your continuous integration to enforce your team&amp;rsquo;s style guidelines and look for line-level bugs. In Python, this might include running mypy, flake8, black, and isort. Automation like this has multiple benefits: they&amp;rsquo;re often better than humans at this task, they reduce cognative load on the reviewer, and they reduce interpersonal tension that results from interviewers nitpicking code.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Things to evaluate:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Does the code appear to do what it claims to do? (This requires you understanding what the code claims to do; you may need to ask the code author to write a better description.)&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Was the new code put in the right place?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Is the new code unnecessarily complex—or unnecessarily clever?&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&amp;ldquo;Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it. &amp;quot; – Brian Kernighan&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Does the new code do all it can to avoid adding to the overall complexity of our codebase?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Did the author write tests for the new code?&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Clarify when a comment is minor or not essential for merging (for example, preface with &amp;ldquo;Nit: &amp;ldquo;).&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If a PR is too large for you to reasonably review, you can ask the author to split it into multiple PRs.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>

>I
tweeted&lt;/a>, &amp;ldquo;Trying to
learn Python. We&amp;rsquo;ll see if this keeps up once classes start.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On January 20, 2011, ten years ago today, I bought Mark Lutz&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://amzn.to/3sHDwXa" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Learning Python&lt;/a> from O&amp;rsquo;Reilly Books. Over the next month, I
read it on my Kindle on the Stairmaster at the school gym. It changed the
course of my adult life: since reading that book, I&amp;rsquo;ve written Python on more
days than I haven&amp;rsquo;t.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before discovering the data science Twitter community in late 2010, I&amp;rsquo;d only
heard of Python through another student researcher in my 2007
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>REU,&lt;/a> who had used Python for some graphics
programming research. On Twitter, people like &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/hmason" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hilary
Mason&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/JohnDCook" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>John
Cook&lt;/a>, and &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/fonnesbeck" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Chris
Fonnesbeck&lt;/a> talked warmly about using Python
in their scientific work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2011, I was a first-year operations research student at North Carolina
State University, and I realized that I should pick up programming again to
improve my career prospects. I&amp;rsquo;d taught myself some PHP in high school (circa
2003). In undergrad, I did a computer science minor and learned a good bit of
C++ and did a lot of Mathematica scripting in my math coursework, but from
2008 to 2011, I basically didn&amp;rsquo;t program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/132924915526533120" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>I struggled to use
Python&lt;/a> in practice
for ML/scientific computing in those days before wheels (binary installs);
libraries like Scipy and Numpy required brittle compilation of C++ and Fortran
dependencies. During the summer of 2011, I gave up using Python (&lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/73798291648811008" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>after
segfaulting&lt;/a>
&lt;a class="link" href="https://orangedatamining.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Orange&lt;/a>) for my internship at &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Robotics" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Kiva Systems&lt;/a> and dove into R, where
I could install packages more reliably and use
&lt;a class="link" href="https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ggplot2&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For some reason (probably because of Twitter), I returned to Python a year
later and used it to write my research code in grad school (despite my
advisor&amp;rsquo;s wishes that I use C++). &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/fonnesbeck/ScipySuperpack" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Scipy Superpack&lt;/a> for installing the
Scipy stack was invaluable (thankfully now replaced by Wheels and Conda).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My experience with Python was a big reason I got hired at &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.rti.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>RTI International&lt;/a> when I left my PhD program in October. They were looking to reduce their SAS dependency (and costs) and wanted
people experienced with open-source tools. I taught my colleagues a &amp;ldquo;Python for
statisticians&amp;rdquo; seminar soon after joining RTI.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>From RTI, I joined Parsely, which was like a Python boot camp working with &lt;a class="link" href="https://amontalenti.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Andrew Montalenti&lt;/a> and others. Parsely uses Python across
their full stack, and it was an eye-opening and educational year for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve worked at a variety of companies where I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to use
Python for training machine learning models, building machine learning
platforms, &lt;a class="link" href="https://dp.tdhopper.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>writing Gibbs samplers for nonparametric Bayes&lt;/a>, building data engineering pipelines, software
testing, etc.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I use Python almost every single day for work and a lot of personal projects.
I&amp;rsquo;ve been able &lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/talks" >to speak&lt;/a> at 3 PyData conferences,
a Scipy conference, and a number &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.meetup.com/tripython/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Triangle Python Users Groups&lt;/a>. I had a &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11847" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>contribution merged into CPython in 2019&lt;/a> and have
contributed to many other open-source projects.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m grateful to the countless people who have taught me (through tweets, code

&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Start Working Early&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
If you can&amp;rsquo;t find someone to chat with for 30 minutes while making coffee, consider starting your workday instead.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Simulate Office Noise&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
If you miss the background noise of your office, try listening to 8 hours of power drill noises &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNu4cNgJ-Hs" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. For a more realistic ambiance, you can overlay it with the most annoying laugh ever &lt;a class="link" href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=9WcSaIAa5Ac" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Afternoon Activities&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Without a ping-pong table at home, you might find yourself with nothing to do but work in the afternoons.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Familiarize Yourself with Remote Tools&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
Programmers, take some time to get used to the essential tools for remote work, such as Jira, GitHub, Slack, and Zoom.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Engage in Local Politics&lt;/strong>&lt;br>
If the quarantine lasts longer than expected and you start to miss petty workplace politics, consider joining your local HOA.&lt;/li>

>pdb&lt;/a>, the Python interactive debugger in conjunction with Pytest as I&amp;rsquo;m writing code.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> With the &lt;code>--pdb&lt;/code> flag, you can have Pytest drop into pdb when a test fails. With &lt;code>pytest.set_trace()&lt;/code>, you can selectively enter pdb while running your tests. (I use this where I might&amp;rsquo;ve just added print statements in the past.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A colleague uses IPython for most of his interactive development and asked me for help with some of the friction in his workflow. I recommended pdb, but he wanted to stick with the familiar IPython repl for much of his work.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> He figured how to &lt;a class="link" href="https://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/interactive/reference.html#embedding" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>drop into an IPython repl&lt;/a> from pdb with &lt;code>from IPython import embed; embed()&lt;/code>. You can&amp;rsquo;t move up and down the call stack until you exit the repl, but you have access to all the local state you have in pdb.&lt;sup id="fnref1:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To simplify this, I recommended leveraging two little-known pdb features: &lt;code>alias&lt;/code> and &lt;code>.pdbrc&lt;/code>. &lt;a class="link" href="https://docs.python.org/3/library/pdb.html#debugger-aliases" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>alias&lt;/code>&lt;/a> allows you to set alias for statements in pdb; in this case &lt;code>ipy&lt;/code> as an alias that drops into IPython:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">alias ipy from IPython import embed; embed()
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>pdb also as the ability to load a config file from the user&amp;rsquo;s home directory or the current working directory. Each line in the file is just a pdb statement. Thus, if you can create &lt;code>~/.pdbrc&lt;/code> and add the alias statement above, the &lt;code>ipy&lt;/code> command becomes available in every pdb session for your user.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="footnotes" role="doc-endnotes">
&lt;hr>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li id="fn:1">
&lt;p>I highly recommend pip installing &lt;a class="link" href="https://pypi.org/project/pdbpp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>pdbpp&lt;/a>, which replaces the default pdb with an enhanced debugger with syntax highlighting, tab completion, and more.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:2">
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s also an alternative debugger for Python based on IPython: &lt;a class="link" href="https://pypi.org/project/ipdb/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>ipdb&lt;/a>.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref1:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

>Sebastian Gutierrez&lt;/a> published a collection of interviews entitled &lt;a class="link" href="https://amzn.to/2Lo0A7s" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Data Scientists at Work&lt;/a>. My friend and former boss Eric Jonas posted &lt;a class="link" href="http://ericjonas.com/datascientistsatwork.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>his interview on his website&lt;/a>. It&amp;rsquo;s full of gems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On engineering skills required for data science work, Eric says,&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>On the industry side, I think that the ability to do software engineering is something that is very important, but isn’t really taught. You don’t actually learn it as a computer science undergraduate, and you certainly don’t learn it as a graduate student. So for me it’s very important that someone has learned it somehow—either by themselves or from someone else. &lt;strong>I basically can’t hire people who don’t know Git.&lt;/strong>&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>On someone trained in pure mathematics learning to analysis of real-world data, Eric says:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;hellip;data analysis is so much messier than actual math. I have friends who work on these topology-based approaches, and I’m like, “You realize these manifolds totally evaporate when you actually throw noise into the system. How do you think this is really going to play out here?” So I would much rather someone be computationally skilled. I’m willing to trade off what their Putnam score was for how many open source GitHub projects they’ve committed to in the past.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I tried to argue this same point in &lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/how/" >an earlier post&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On applying academic research, Eric observes:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For example, when I evaluate machine learning papers, what I am looking to find out is whether the technique worked or not. &lt;strong>This is something that the world needs to know—most papers don’t actually tell you whether the thing worked.&lt;/strong> It’s really infuriating because most papers will show five dataset examples and then show that they’re slightly better on two different metrics when comparing against something from 20 years ago. In academia, it’s fine. In industry, it’s infuriating, because you need to know what actually works and what doesn’t.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I have suggested before that we need a good website for sharing implementations of academic algorithms and providing a forum for discussion of whether or not the algorithm &lt;em>actually works&lt;/em>.&lt;/p>

wrote a post called &amp;ldquo;How I Became a Data Scientist Despite Being a Math
Major&amp;rdquo;.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I wrote the post, I thought I was explaining that that was about all I
know about how someone can become a data scientist: that is, I shared my
subjective experience. I intended to communicate my uncertainty about the path
others should take. But, given the number of people who have read the post and
emailed asking for my advice on becoming a data scientist, that message wasn&amp;rsquo;t
clear. With most of these emails, I have felt bad because I simply don&amp;rsquo;t know
the answers to the questions people have. But because so many people seem to
have these questions, I decided to consolidate my uncertainty here. I hope you
find it helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A note before the Q&amp;amp;A: one reason it is so hard to advise someone on becoming
a &amp;ldquo;data scientist&amp;rdquo; is that &amp;ldquo;data scientist&amp;rdquo; is an ill-defined job title. At
some companies, data scientists are building machine learning models and
running them in a high performance production system. At other data companies,
data scientists are business analysts running SQL queries and visualizing the
results with Tableau. Some data scientist are doing complex experimental
design while others are mostly moving files around S3 buckets. Some data
science roles require deep domain expertise, others only need some programming
skill and knowledge of Scikit-Learn. As you shape your own path to data
science, take some time to think specifically about the kind of work you are
interested in doing; this will shape your preparation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="should-i-get-a-masters-degree">Should I get a masters degree?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>My sense is that a good masters degree in a technical field is a valuable
degree. It takes a fraction of the time a Ph.D. takes, yet you can learn a lot
in 3 or 4 semesters of coursework, and the degree is viewed favoribly by
employers. The quality and curriculum of masters programs varies wildly, so
you&amp;rsquo;ll want to do your due diligence before diving in.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That said, I&amp;rsquo;m wary of people going into deep debt for a masters degree. If
you can get a teaching or research position that waives your tuition, do it.
Consider going a &lt;em>good&lt;/em> school on in-state tuition instead of a &lt;em>great&lt;/em> school
for $100,000. If you have publicly subsidized graduate education (as in many
European countries), go for it!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="will-a-masters-degree-help-me-becomebe-a-data-scientist">Will a masters degree help me become/be a data scientist?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know, but it has helped me. As I said in &lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/" >my earlier
post&lt;/a>, I learned a
lot about algorithms, probability models, math, and machine learning that has
been invaluable. Grad school also gave me the time and inspiration to learn R
and Python which have played important roles in my career?&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="should-i-get-a-masters-degree-in-computer-science-will-it-help-me-become-a-data-scientist">Should I get a masters degree in computer science? Will it help me become a data scientist?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I think a masters degree in computer science will be likely to pay off in the
long run. It may not help you get a job as a data scientist, but it would
undoubtedly help you in a data science job.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have half of a computer science masters, and I sometimes wish I had finished
it.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="should-i-get-a-masters-degree-in-operations-research">Should I get a masters degree in operations research?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m ambivalent about operations research. As a discipline, operations research
has been in an identity crisis. As a curriculum, many operations research
programs are full of content valuable for data scientists. As a signal to
potential employers, operations research is relatively unknown and won&amp;rsquo;t mean
as much as a degree in &amp;ldquo;machine learning&amp;rdquo; or similar.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="did-you-feel-that-operations-research-was-too-theoretical-and-that-you-had-to-hustle-outside-the-classroom-and-build-statml-skills-separately">Did you feel that operations research was too theoretical and that you had to hustle outside the classroom and build stat/ML skills separately?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Operations research programs have wildly different curriculums. Mine didn&amp;rsquo;t do
a great job preparing me for real-world applications, but that might be better
learned on the job anyway. My program allowed me to build statistics and ML
expertise only because I had flexibility in the courses I could select; I was
able to take a handful of stats/ML related classes. Other programs might not
offer that.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="should-i-get-a-masters-degree-in-statistics">Should I get a masters degree in statistics?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If you have strong programming/software engineering skills (or have another
means of building them), a statistics degree could be valuable; as with
anything, I&amp;rsquo;m sure the quality of statistics masters degrees varies greatly,
and it&amp;rsquo;s worth trying to find a good one.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="should-i-get-a-phd">Should I get a Ph.D.?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://mobile.twitter.com/shouldyougetphd" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

people.&lt;/a> It&amp;rsquo;s also not necessary
for the vast majority of data science jobs. &lt;a class="link" href="https://shouldigetaphd.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>I have a dedicated website to
help you answer this question.&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There are a lot of people with Ph.D.&amp;rsquo;s in data science roles. It&amp;rsquo;s possible
that is more a result of the large difference in the number Ph.D.&amp;rsquo;s verses the
small number of permanent faculty positions in American universities. People
with Ph.D.&amp;rsquo;s need jobs; many have skills overlapping with data science; they
make their way from academia to data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="can-i-become-a-data-scientist-with-only-an-undergraduate-degree">Can I become a data scientist with only an undergraduate degree?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Many others have. I have known several who don&amp;rsquo;t even have college degrees.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="im-in-school-should-i-take-x-class">I&amp;rsquo;m in school should I take X class?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If it&amp;rsquo;s linear algebra, definitely. Otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;m not sure. Among other
reasons, I&amp;rsquo;ve been often surprised how classes I never expected to apply have
helped me years later; it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to know what other classes would&amp;rsquo;ve
helped me had I taken them.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Take the best professors you can (note I didn&amp;rsquo;t say &lt;em>easiest&lt;/em> ). Talk to older
students you admire about different classes and professors. Don&amp;rsquo;t let your
schooling interfere with your education.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="can-you-evaluate-my-qualifications-for-being-a-data-scientist">Can you evaluate my qualifications for being a data scientist?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Not very well. In fact, &lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/blog/some-reflections-on-being-turned-down-for-a-lot-of-data-science-jobs/" >I think it&amp;rsquo;s pretty challenging&lt;/a> even for people who interview data science
candidates. &lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/blog/how-i-became-a-data-scientist/" >I have tried to share the things that helped qualify
me&lt;/a>, and I imagine
those things would be valuable for you as well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would suggest trying to evaluate your qualifications against specific jobs
(or job descriptions) you are interested in. Are you more interested in

>analysis or production systems&lt;/a>? Are you interested
cybersecurity applications? Ad markets? Social good? Journalism? Finance?
Healthcare? Self-driving cars? Find job postings for roles and look at the
qualifications. Find people in these roles on Linkedin and look at their
qualifications and job history.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One other note: just because you&amp;rsquo;re qualified, doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you will get job
offers. Not getting an offer after interviewing &lt;em>might&lt;/em> reflect more on poor
interviewers than being a poor candidate.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I have always believed that scientific research is another domain where a form of optimism is essential to success: I have yet to meet a successful scientist who lacks the ability to exaggerate the importance of what he or she is doing, and I believe that someone who lacks a delusional sense of significance will wilt in the face of repeated experiences of multiple small failures and rare successes, the fate of most researchers.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>John earned his Ph.D. in applied math at UT Austin in 1992 with a dissertation
on partial differential equations entitled &lt;a class="link" href="http://catalog.lib.utexas.edu/search~S2?/acook/acook/1%2C109%2C119%2CB/frameset&amp;amp;FF=acook&amp;#43;john&amp;#43;douglas&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;#43;&amp;#43;1966&amp;amp;1%2C1%2C" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Diffusion models with
microstructure and secondary
flux&lt;/a>.
In the years since, he has worked as a math professor at Vanderbilt, a
software developer, a research statistician at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,
and, since 2013, an independent consultant in statistics, mathematics, and
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/expert-hipaa-deidentification/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>HIPAA expert determination&lt;/a>. His breadth of career experience reflect his breadth of
interests that make his blog what it is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Though John has (wisely) avoided labeling himself a data scientist (preferring
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.johndcook.com/veryappliedmath.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>very applied mathematician&lt;/a>),
his writings have shaped every aspect of my trajectory from being a operations
research grad student to a practicing data scientist. John is an &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.johndcook.com/blog/bayesian-consulting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

technical topics in &lt;del>140&lt;/del> 280 characters or less. I&amp;rsquo;m always learning little

&lt;p>The downside of this is you have to have two production stacks&amp;hellip; which is kind of expensive, but it&amp;rsquo;s dirt cheap compared to amount of money people spend on developers hacking away at things that are making them crazy. This is one of those things that drives me crazy about companies&amp;hellip; We will gladly spend a million dollars in overtime in developers to sit and work on our antiquated infrastructure, but we won&amp;rsquo;t spend a thousand dollars to buy a new machine to make them not have to do do that.&lt;/p>

Zen of Git
Ugly is better than beautiful.
Explicit is better than implicit.
Complex is better than simple.
Complicated is better than complex.
Flat is better than nested.
Readability is meaningless.
Special cases are everything.
Errors should never be comprehensible.
In the face of ambiguity, copy and paste from Stack Overflow.
There should be no obvious way to do it.
Although there may be endless non obvious ways to do it.
If the documentation is hard to understand, it's a great idea.
If the documentation is easy to understand, it's probably for another tool.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>

&lt;p>In particular, I make a lot of bar charts (including histograms), line plots (including time series), scatter plots, and density plots from data in Pandas data frames. I often want to facet these on various categorical variables and layer them on a common grid.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To that end, I made &lt;a class="link" href="http://pythonplot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I spent the Fall quarter (of 1950) at RAND. My first task was to find a name for multistage decision processes. “An interesting question is, ‘Where did the name, dynamic programming, come from?’ The 1950s were not good years for mathematical research.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We had a very interesting gentleman in Washington named Wilson. He was Secretary of Defense, and he actually had a pathological fear and hatred of the word, research. I’m not using the term lightly; I’m using it precisely. His face would suffuse, he would turn red, and he would get violent if people used the term, research, in his presence. You can imagine how he felt, then, about the term, mathematical.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The RAND Corporation was employed by the Air Force, and the Air Force had Wilson as its boss, essentially. Hence, I felt I had to do something to shield Wilson and the Air Force from the fact that I was really doing mathematics inside the RAND Corporation. What title, what name, could I choose? In the first place I was interested in planning, in decision making, in thinking. But planning, is not a good word for various reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I decided therefore to use the word, ‘programming.’ I wanted to get across the idea that this was dynamic, this was multistage, this was time-varying—I thought, let’s kill two birds with one stone. Let’s take a word that has an absolutely precise meaning, namely dynamic, in the classical physical sense. It also has a very interesting property as an adjective, and that is it’s impossible to use the word, dynamic, in a pejorative sense. Try thinking of some combination that will possibly give it a pejorative meaning. It’s impossible.
Thus, I thought dynamic programming was a good name. It was something not even a Congressman could object to. So I used it as an umbrella for my activities.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In 2017, teaching people to focus is becoming a &lt;a class="link" href="https://thefocuscourse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>industry&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to rethink distractions in my own life, particularly in my work environment. Here are some things that have helped:&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="working-from-home">Working from Home
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Working in an office, especially an open-floor plan office, is disastrous for staying focused. DeMarco and Lister wrote about this in &lt;a class="link" href="http://amzn.to/2px5PGj" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Peopleware&lt;/a> 30 years ago, and yet open offices are the norm for startups today.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m much more productive by working from home in my quiet office or on my back patio. I&amp;rsquo;m finally able to spend my time thinking about hard problems rather than ways of silencing Constant Throat Clearer or Perpetual Annoying Laugher.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="notifications">Notifications
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Every app and website these days wants to send you notifications. I&amp;rsquo;m aggressive about &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/take-control-ios-notifications-iphone-ipad/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>reducing notifications&lt;/a> down to those that I &lt;em>need&lt;/em> see, and I let almost nothing notify me with sound. I use Do Not Disturb mode on my phone and &lt;a class="link" href="https://support.apple.com/kb/PH18740?locale=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mac&lt;/a> whenever I need to stop notifications altogether.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="slack">Slack
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://slack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Slack&lt;/a> has become the new normal for company communication. Some would say Slack itself is ruining our focus, but having it regularly available has been essential for my own work.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a few ways to take control of Slack:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Only show &amp;ldquo;My unread, along with everything I&amp;rsquo;ve starred&amp;rdquo; in the sidebar. See Michael Lopp&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-i-slack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>excellent post on Slack&lt;/a> for more here.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Enable notifications selectively.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Sign out of distracting avocational Slacks.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h2 id="social-media">Social Media
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve started using an app called &lt;a class="link" href="https://heyfocus.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Focus&lt;/a> to block distracting websites (including Facebook and Twitter.com) and apps on my work computer from 9 AM to 5:30 PM. I use Focus&amp;rsquo;s scheduling feature so blocking isn&amp;rsquo;t optional for me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve decided &lt;em>not&lt;/em> to block &lt;a class="link" href="https://tapbots.com/tweetbot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tweetbot&lt;/a>. Though it can be distracting, Twitter is an invaluable way for me to learn from my professional colleagues, bounce ideas off of them, and have a good laugh.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On my iPhone, iPad, and personal Laptop, I&amp;rsquo;ve started using &lt;a class="link" href="https://freedom.refersion.com/c/c6bad" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Freedom&lt;/a> to block all social media during the day. This has stopped me from instinctively checking Instagram every time I walk to the bathroom or get suck on a hard problem. I highly recommend it.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I also use Freedom to block social media for the first hour I&amp;rsquo;m up in the morning and before I go to bed.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="email">Email
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I have two main tactics to keep email from being distracting.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>I aggressively unsubscribe from mailing lists and ads.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I use &lt;a class="link" href="https://sanebox.com/t/49nyh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Sanebox&lt;/a> to filter low priority messages out of my inbox.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>When emails only need a brief reply, I tend to write responses as soon as possible. At the moment, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to break people of the expectation that I&amp;rsquo;ll respond quickly. Using services like &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.boomeranggmail.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Boomerang&lt;/a> which lets me write emails now and have them sent later helps here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="reading">Reading
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Long-form reading at the computer is terrible for comprehension. As &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.econtalk.org/archives/2016/11/doug_lemov_on_r.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Doug Lemov has argued&lt;/a>, you have to get away from your computer &lt;strong>and&lt;/strong> other devices to read deeply. I do this by &lt;a class="link" href="http://amzn.to/2oDATHj" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>printing&lt;/a> articles or reading on my iPad with &lt;a class="link" href="https://freedom.refersion.com/c/c6bad" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Freedom blocking enabled&lt;/a>. I take my printouts or iPad and walk away from my desk to read.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="todo-items">Todo Items
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a firm believer in the &lt;a class="link" href="http://amzn.to/2ovAgit" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Getting Things Done&lt;/a> principle of reducing the cognitive overhead of tracking to-do items in my head. I use Omnifocus for task management. &lt;a class="link" href="https://support.omnigroup.com/omnifocus-mail-drop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mail Drop&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="http://bachyaproductions.com/better-omnifocus-task-entry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this&lt;/a> Alfred workflow help me to quickly add tasks to my Omnifocus inbox. When I think of something I need to take care of outside of work, I drop that thought into Omnifocus; this keeps those personal to-do items from distracting me while I&amp;rsquo;m working.&lt;/p>
&lt;hr>
&lt;p>Staying focused is hard. I&amp;rsquo;m still learning how to do it well, and I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;m not the only one struggling to improve here. If you have any tips to share, I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear them!&lt;/p>

My friend Hunter and I
were big into making terrible Angelfire sites as pre-teens. In high school, my
dad paid me to make him a webpage for his doctor&amp;rsquo;s office (I used Frontpage).
A year or two after that, I read Kevin Yank&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;Build Your Own Database Driven
Website Using PHP &amp;amp; MySQL&amp;rdquo; and hacked together a PHP back-end for a Lord of
the Rings fan site.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In recent years, I&amp;rsquo;ve put together this blog,
&lt;a class="link" href="http://shouldigetaphd.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>shouldigetaphd.com&lt;/a>, and a few other simple &lt;a class="link" href="https://shouldigetaphd.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>side&lt;/a>
&lt;a class="link" href="https://dp.tdhopper.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>projects&lt;/a>. However, I haven&amp;rsquo;t kept up with modern
web development, and my projects have been hacked together from boilerplate or
templates. I&amp;rsquo;ve programmed professionally since 2011, I&amp;rsquo;ve spent very little
of that writing anything close to graphical user interfaces.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a number of other side projects that I&amp;rsquo;d like to do at some point, and
most of them would require some sort of graphical interface. While I could
work on app development, I think web-based implementations would be a great
starting place.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A few months back, I decided to stop watching Netflix on the treadmill and
instead use those 45 minutes each morning to learn; in particular, I&amp;rsquo;ve been
trying to learn more about modern(ish) web design and development. My work has
a subscription to &lt;a class="link" href="http://safaribooksonline.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Safari Books Online&lt;/a> which
gives me access to copious technical books and video tutorials.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The number of resources available on Safari (along with YouTube, blog posts,
etc) is astounding. I started many video tutorials on Safari that I quickly
realized weren&amp;rsquo;t going to be useful. Yet there many gems to be found, which I
share here with you.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What follows is an overview of the technologies I&amp;rsquo;ve realized I need to learn
more about and links to the resources I&amp;rsquo;ve found valuable in learning about
them. If you think there are gaps I haven&amp;rsquo;t yet filled or better resources
than I&amp;rsquo;ve listed below, I&amp;rsquo;d love your feedback.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-i-knew-going-in">What I Knew Going In
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been a professional software developer and data scientist since 2012. I
mostly write Python, but I&amp;rsquo;ve programmed in a number of different languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a pretty good grasp on how HTML and CSS work. I&amp;rsquo;ve used enough
Javascript over the years to be dangerous; I understood how it runs in the
browsers. I understand what a DOM is and how it relates to the page source.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve used the &lt;a class="link" href="http://flask.pocoo.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Python Flask web framework&lt;/a> for
several projects. I understand how to repond to HTTP requests with server-
generated content. I had some idea of how to run my own web server on AWS.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve used &lt;a class="link" href="https://jekyllrb.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jekyll&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="http://gohugo.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hugo&lt;/a>, and
&lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.getpelican.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pelican&lt;/a> to create statically generated sites.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I understood DNS at a high level, but never really learned what all the
different DNS types were, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t understand why name server changes take
so long to propagate.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I had some idea of what &lt;a class="link" href="https://nodejs.org/en/" title="Node.js"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>node.js&lt;/a> and
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.npmjs.com/" title="npm"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>npm&lt;/a> are.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;m a committed Sublime Text user.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="a-meta-tutorial-on-web-development">A Meta Tutorial on Web Development
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>A great place to start is Andrew Montalenti&amp;rsquo;s lengthy tutorial on using
Python, Flask, Bootstrap, and Mongo to rapidly prototype a website. The
tutorial is out of date, but the principles still stand.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another great resource is Cody Lindley&amp;rsquo;s free &lt;a class="link" href="https://frontendmasters.com/books/front-end-handbook/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Front-End Developer&amp;rsquo;s
Handbook&lt;/a>. This is a
substantial list meta-resource that organizes links for learning all angles of
front-end development. &amp;ldquo;It is specifically written with the intention of being
a professional resource for potential and currently practicing front-end
developers to equip themselves with learning materials and development tools.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="chrome-developer-tools">Chrome Developer Tools
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>One of the most important tools for me in learning more about web development
has been the &lt;a class="link" href="https://developer.chrome.com/devtools" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Chrome Developer Tools&lt;/a>.
You can live edit the DOM elements and style sheets and watch how a website
changes. I&amp;rsquo;ve mostly learned Developer Tools through exploring it myself, but
there are lots of tutorials for it on Youtube.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="html-css-and-bootstrap">HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Many modern websites are
&lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>responsive&lt;/a>: they
automatically adapt to various size screens and devices, from phones to
desktops. Writing responsive websites from scratch requires deep knowledge of
HTML, CSS, Javascript, and browsers. Unless you&amp;rsquo;re doing this professionally,
you probably don&amp;rsquo;t want to write a responsive site from scratch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For several projects, I&amp;rsquo;ve used the lightweight
&lt;a class="link" href="http://getskeleton.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Skeleton&lt;/a> project to create simple, responsive
pages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I decide to dive deep into the more robust &lt;a class="link" href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Bootstrap
framework&lt;/a> originally developed at Twitter.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched Brock Nunn&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/110000475.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Building a Responsive Website with Bootstrap
&lt;/a>
(&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/building-a-responsive/9781782164982/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Safari&lt;/a>), a two hour tutorial on getting started with
Bootstrap. The &lt;a class="link" href="http://getbootstrap.com/getting-started/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>documentation for Bootstrap&lt;/a> is clear (if terse) and worth reading through.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once you have a basic idea of how Bootstrap works, the best thing you can do
is start playing with it. Since I was familiar with the Pelican static site
generator, I decided to switch this blog to Bootstrap theme starting with
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/getpelican/pelican-themes/tree/master/pelican-bootstrap3" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>pelican-bootstrap3&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve worked with Bootstrap 3 until now. Bootstrap 4 is about to come out.
&lt;a class="link" href="https://v4-alpha.getbootstrap.com/migration/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Bootstrap 4 moves the style sheets from LESS to SASS and adds Flexbox
functionality&lt;/a>. Unless you
understand what those mean (more below), you&amp;rsquo;d be fine using version 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wanted to get a better grasp on CSS Selectors, so I read Eric Meyer&amp;rsquo;s brief
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.amazon.com/Selectors-Specificity-Cascade-Applying-Documents/dp/1449342493/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1490966101&amp;amp;sr=8-3&amp;amp;linkCode=li2&amp;amp;tag=dothopper-20&amp;amp;linkId=260c71eee0317cf531ad099db4c8a816" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Safari&lt;/a>)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I watched Marty Hall&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.coreservlets.com/javascript-jquery-tutorial/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>JavaScript, jQuery, and jQuery
UI&lt;/a> tutorial). I was
able to skip big chunks where I already understood certain parts, but it
helped me fill in lots of gaps.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="advanced-stylesheets-less-sass-and-flexbox">Advanced Stylesheets (LESS, SASS, and Flexbox)
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>There are several alternatives to writing raw CSS. Two popular ones are
&lt;a class="link" href="http://lesscss.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Less&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="http://sass-lang.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SASS&lt;/a>. These
&amp;ldquo;preprocessors&amp;rdquo; allow you to write CSS-like stylesheets but with constructs
such as variables, nesting, inheritance, and mathematical operators.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I found this &lt;a class="link" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920051213.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Less&lt;/a>
(&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/learning-less/9781783989867/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Safari&lt;/a>) helpful, and I&amp;rsquo;ve enjoyed Less a lot. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used
SASS yet, but it&amp;rsquo;s very similar. I&amp;rsquo;ll probably switch to SASS when I start
using Bootstrap 4.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another modern innovation is the &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CSS_Flex_Box_Layout" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Flexbox layout

>Safari&lt;/a>). It seems that Flexbox is the future of CSS-based
layouts, and it&amp;rsquo;s worth learning about.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="advanced-javascript-elm-react-angular-backbone-ember">Advanced JavaScript (Elm, React, Angular, Backbone, Ember)
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The JavaScript web framework space has exploded. Many of these are

These tools allow the creation of complex web apps (as well as mobile apps).&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="web-server-operations-and-dns">Web Server Operations and DNS
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>I learned a ton form &lt;a class="link" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920006066.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Linux Web

(&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.safaribooksonline.com/library/view/linux-web-operations/9780133927757/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Safari&lt;/a>) by Ben Whaley. &amp;ldquo;The videos discuss the
relationship between web and application servers, load balancers, and
databases and introduce configuration management, monitoring, containers,
cryptography, and DNS.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve struggled with DNS configuration over the years, so I watched Cricket
Liu&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920040088.do" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

complex DNS infrastructure, but I can now configure my own sites DNS with a
little more understanding.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="development-automation">Development Automation
&lt;/h3>&lt;h4 id="package-managers">Package Managers
&lt;/h4>&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s likely that any modern web project will have some external Javascript
dependencies. Package managers (analogous to Pypi or Anaconda.org on Python)
have emerged to help support this. Node.js comes with the npm package manager,
but &lt;a class="link" href="https://bower.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Bower&lt;/a> seems to make more sense for front-end
development.[^yarn] &lt;a class="link" href="http://codylindley.com/techpro/2013_04_12__package-managers-an-introducto/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Cody Lindley has a nice introduction to npm and Bower&lt;/a>. Bower is &lt;a class="link" href="https://bower.io" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>well documented&lt;/a> and easy to start
using. There is a nice &lt;a class="link" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Flask-Bower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Flask extension&lt;/a> to help you integrate Bower with your Python project. (Update: since
writing this, &lt;a class="link" href="https://yarnpkg.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Yarn&lt;/a> has come to dominate this
scene.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h4 id="task-automation">Task Automation
&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Web development comes with lots of build-style tasks that have to happen
repeatedly. For example, before you can render a webpage in the browser, you
might need to convert the Less to CSS and start a local web server. Before
deploying to production, you might want to also run tests and minify your
Javascript.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>There&amp;rsquo;s a GUI application called &lt;a class="link" href="https://codekitapp.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Codekit&lt;/a> that can
do a lot of these tasks. You can also do it through a Node.js program called
&lt;a class="link" href="https://gruntjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Grunt&lt;/a>. I haven&amp;rsquo;t used it yet, but it looks like
following the documentation would be the best way to get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://gulpjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;h3 id="design">Design
&lt;/h3>&lt;h4 id="visual-design">Visual Design
&lt;/h4>&lt;p>Design has never been my strong point. One way to compensate for that is to
rely on the work of others. There are copious &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.google.com/search?q=bootstrap&amp;#43;theme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Bootstrap themes
available&lt;/a>, and some are even

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve learned a lot in the past few months. I&amp;rsquo;ve filled in some gaps about how
CSS works. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten a better grasp on the Javascript prototype model. I&amp;rsquo;ve
learned that I can start with higher level tools (e.g. Bootstrap and JQuery)
to rapidly build my side projects with some amount of visual appeal. I&amp;rsquo;m
learning how to use available tools to reduce the boilerplate I have to write,
automate tedious tasks, and reduce my personal technical debt.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I still have a lot of learning and a lot of practicing ahead of me, but I&amp;rsquo;m
starting to feel confident that I could make headway on some of my projects.
The modern &lt;a class="link" href="https://medium.com/@withinsight1/the-front-end-spectrum-c0f30998c9f0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

shouldn&amp;rsquo;t prohibit you from diving in if you want to.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Automating Python with Ansible</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/automating-python-with-ansible/</link><pubDate>Thu, 23 Mar 2017 15:11:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/automating-python-with-ansible/</guid><description>&lt;p>I wrote &lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/blog/data-scientists-need-more-automation/" >a few months back&lt;/a> about how data scientists need more automation. In
particular, I suggested that data scientists would be wise to learn more about
automated system configuration and automated deployments.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In an attempt to take my own advice, I&amp;rsquo;ve finally been making myself learn
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ansible&lt;/a>. It turns out that a great way to learn it
is to sit down and read through the docs, front to back; I commend that tactic
to you. I also put together this tutorial to walk through a practical example
of how a working data scientist might use this powerful tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>What follows is an Ansible guide that will take you from installing Ansible to
automatically deploying a long-running Python to a remote machine and running
it in a &lt;a class="link" href="https://conda.io/docs/using/envs.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Conda environment&lt;/a> using
&lt;a class="link" href="http://supervisord.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>supervisord&lt;/a>. It presumes your development machine
is on OS X and the remote machine is Debian-like; however, it shouldn&amp;rsquo;t
require too many changes to run it on other systems.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wrote this post in a Jupyter notebook with a Bash kernel. You can find the
notebook, Ansible files, and installation directions on &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/tdhopper/automating_python" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>my
Github&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="ansible">Ansible
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Ansible provides &amp;ldquo;human readable automation&amp;rdquo; for &amp;ldquo;app deployment&amp;rdquo; and
&amp;ldquo;configuration management&amp;rdquo;. Unlike tools like Chef, it doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an
agent to be running on remote machines. In short, it translates declarative
YAML files into shell commands and runs them on your machines over SSH.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Ansible is backed by Red Hat and has a great
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>website&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-ansible-with-homebrew">Installing Ansible with Homebrew
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>First, you&amp;rsquo;ll need to &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/intro_installation.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>install
Ansible&lt;/a>. On a Mac, I
recommend doing this with &lt;a class="link" href="https://brew.sh/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Homebrew&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>brew install ansible
Warning: ansible-2.1.0.0 already installed
Warning: You are using OS X 10.12.
We do not provide support for this pre-release version.
You may encounter build failures or other breakages.
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="quickstart">Quickstart
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Soon, I&amp;rsquo;ll show you how to put write an Ansible YAML file. However, Ansible
also allows you specify tasks from the command line.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how we could use Ansible ping our local host:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ansible -i 'localhost,' -c local -m ping all
ansible -i 'localhost,' -c local -m ping all
localhost | SUCCESS =&amp;gt; {
&amp;quot;changed&amp;quot;: false,
&amp;quot;ping&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;pong&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This command calls ansible and tells it:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>To use &lt;code>localhost&lt;/code> as it&amp;rsquo;s inventory (&lt;code>-i&lt;/code>). Inventory is Ansible speak for machine or machines you want to be able to run commands on.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To connect (&lt;code>-c&lt;/code>) locally (&lt;code>local&lt;/code>) instead of over SSH.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To run the &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/ping_module.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>ping&lt;/code> module&lt;/a> (&lt;code>-m&lt;/code>) to test the connection.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>To run the command on &lt;code>all&lt;/code> hosts in the inventory (in this case, our inventory is just the &lt;code>localhost&lt;/code>).&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330023127/http://www.mechanicalfish.net/start-learning-ansible-with-one-line-and-no-files/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Michael Booth&lt;/a> has a
&lt;a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20170330023127/http://www.mechanicalfish.net/start-learning-ansible-with-one-line-and-no-files/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>post&lt;/a> that goes into more detail about
this command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Behind the scenes, Ansible is turning this &lt;code>-m ping&lt;/code> command into shell
commands. (Try running with the &lt;code>-vvv&lt;/code> flag to see what&amp;rsquo;s happening behind the
scenes.) It can also execute arbitrary commands; by default, it&amp;rsquo;ll use the
Bourne shell &lt;code>sh&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ansible all -i 'localhost, ' -c local -a &amp;quot;/bin/echo hello&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h2 id="setting-up-an-ansible-inventory">Setting up an Ansible Inventory
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Instead of specifying our inventory with the &lt;code>-i&lt;/code> flag each time, we should
specify an Ansible inventory file. This file is a text file specifying
machines you have SSH access to; you can also group machines under bracketed
headings. For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>mail.example.com
[webservers]
foo.example.com
bar.example.com
[dbservers]
one.example.com
two.example.com
three.example.com
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Ansible has to be able to connect to these machines over SSH, so you will
likely need to have relevant entries in your &lt;a class="link" href="http://nerderati.com/2011/03/17/simplify-your-life-with-an-ssh-config-file/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>.ssh/config&lt;/code> file&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>By default, the Ansible CLI will look for a system-wide Ansible inventory file
in &lt;code>/etc/ansible/hosts&lt;/code>. You can also specify an alternative path for an
intentory file with the &lt;code>-i&lt;/code> flag.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For this tutorial, I&amp;rsquo;d like to have an inventory file specific to the project
directory without having to specify it each time we call Ansible. We can do
this by creating a file called &lt;code>./ansible.cfg&lt;/code> and set the name of our local
inventory file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cat ./ansible.cfg
cat ./ansible.cfg
[defaults]
inventory = ./hosts
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can check that Ansible is picking up your config file by running &lt;code>ansible --version&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ansible --version
ansible --version
ansible 2.1.0.0
config file = /Users/tdhopper/repos/automating_python/ansible.cfg
configured module search path = Default w/o overrides
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>For this example, I just have one host, a &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Digital Ocean
VPS&lt;/a>. To run the examples below, you should
create a VPS instance on Digital Ocean, &lt;a class="link" href="https://amazonlightsail.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Amazon&lt;/a>,
or elsewhere; you&amp;rsquo;ll want to configure it for &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-set-up-ssh-keys--2" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>passwordless authentication&lt;/a>. I have an entry like this in my &lt;code>~/.ssh/hosts&lt;/code> file:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>Host digitalocean
HostName 45.55.395.23
User root
Port 22
IdentityFile /Users/tdhopper/.ssh/id_rsa
ForwardAgent yes
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>and my intentory file (&lt;code>~/hosts&lt;/code>) is just&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>digitalocean
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Before trying ansible, you should ensure that you can connect to this host:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ssh digitalocean echo 1
ssh digitalocean echo 1
1
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Now I can verify that Ansible can connect to my machine by running the ping
command.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ansible all -m ping
ansible all -m ping
digitalocean | SUCCESS =&amp;gt; {
&amp;quot;changed&amp;quot;: false,
&amp;quot;ping&amp;quot;: &amp;quot;pong&amp;quot;
}
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We told Ansible to run this command on &lt;code>all&lt;/code> specified hosts in the inventory.
It found our inventory by loading the &lt;code>ansible.cfg&lt;/code> which specified &lt;code>./hosts&lt;/code>
as the inventory file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It&amp;rsquo;s possible that this will fail for you even if you can SSH into the
machine. If the error is something like &lt;code>/bin/sh: 1: /usr/bin/python: not found&lt;/code>, this is because your VPS doesn&amp;rsquo;t have Python installed on it. You can
&lt;a class="link" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/32429259/ansible-fails-with-bin-sh-1-usr-bin-python-not-found" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>install it with Ansible&lt;/a>, but you may just want to
manually run &lt;code>sudo apt-get -y install python&lt;/code> on the VPS to get started.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="writing-our-first-playbook">Writing our first Playbook
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>While adhoc commands will often be useful, the real power of Ansible comes
from creating repeatable sets of instructions called
&lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Playbooks&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A playbook contains a list of &amp;ldquo;plays&amp;rdquo;. Each play specifies a set of tasks to
be run and which hosts to run them on. A &amp;ldquo;task&amp;rdquo; is a call to an Ansible
module, like the &amp;ldquo;ping&amp;rdquo; module we&amp;rsquo;ve already seen. Ansible &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/list_of_all_modules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>comes packaged
with about 1000
modules&lt;/a> for all
sorts of use cases. You can also extend it with your own
&lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/dev_guide/developing_modules.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>modules&lt;/a>
and &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html#roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>roles&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Our first playbook will just execute the ping module on all our hosts. It&amp;rsquo;s a
playbook with a single play comprised of a single task.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cat ping.yml
cat ping.yml
---
- hosts: all
tasks:
- name: ping all hosts
ping:
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>We can run our playbook with the &lt;code>ansible-playbook&lt;/code> command.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You might wonder why there are cows on your screen. You can find out
&lt;a class="link" href="https://michaelheap.com/cowsay-and-ansible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>here&lt;/a>. However, the important
thing is that our task was executed and returned successfully.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can override the hosts list for the play with the &lt;code>-i&lt;/code> flag to see what the
output looks like when Ansible fails to run the play because it can&amp;rsquo;t find the
host.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Let&amp;rsquo;s work now on installing the dependencies for our Python project.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="installing-supervisord">Installing supervisord
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to monitor and
control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.&amp;rdquo; We&amp;rsquo;ll use it to
run and monitor our Python process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a Debian-like system, we can install it with APT. In the Ansible DSL that&amp;rsquo;s
just:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>- name: Install supervisord
sudo: yes
apt:
name: supervisor
state: present
update_cache: yes
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can read more about the &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/apt_module.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>apt module
here&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Once we have it installed, we can start it with this task:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>- name: Start supervisord
sudo: yes
service:
name: &amp;quot;supervisor&amp;quot;
state: running
enabled: yes
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This uses the &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/service_module.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>service&lt;/a>
module.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We could add these these tasks to a playbook file (like ping.yml), but what
maybe we will want to share it among multiple playbooks? For this, Ansible has
a construct called
&lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Roles&lt;/a>. A role is a
collection of &amp;ldquo;variable values, certain tasks, and certain handlers – or just
one or more of these things&amp;rdquo;. (You can learn more about variables and handlers
in the Ansible docs.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Roles are organized as subfolders of a folder called &amp;ldquo;Roles&amp;rdquo; in the working
directory. The rapid proliferation of folders in Ansible organization can be
overwhelming, but a very simple rule is just a file called &lt;code>main.yml&lt;/code> nestled
several folders deep. In our case, it&amp;rsquo;s in
&lt;code>./roles/supervisor/tasks/main.yml&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Check out &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_roles.html#roles" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the
docs&lt;/a> to learn
more about role organization.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what our role looks like:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cat ./roles/supervisor/tasks/main.yml
cat ./roles/supervisor/tasks/main.yml
---
- name: Install supervisord
become: true
apt:
name: supervisor
state: present
update_cache: yes
tags:
supervisor
- name: Start supervisord
become: true
service:
name: &amp;quot;supervisor&amp;quot;
state: running
enabled: yes
tags:
supervisor
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Note that I added &lt;code>tags:&lt;/code> to the task definitions.
&lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/playbooks_tags.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Tags&lt;/a> just allow you to
run a portion of a playbook instead of the whole thing with the &lt;code>--tags&lt;/code> flag
for &lt;code>ansible-playbook&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now that we have the supervisor install encapsulated in a role, we can write a
simple playbook to run the role.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cat supervisor.yml
cat supervisor.yml

&lt;h2 id="installing-conda-with-ansible-galaxy">Installing Conda with Ansible Galaxy
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Next we want to ensure that Conda installed on our system. We could write our
own role to follow the &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>recommended
process&lt;/a>. However, Ansible has a helpful
tool to help us avoid reinventing the wheel by allowing users to share roles;
this is called &lt;a class="link" href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ansible Galaxy&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>You can search the Galaxy website for
&lt;a class="link" href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/list#/roles?page=1&amp;amp;page_size=10&amp;amp;autocomplete=miniconda" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>miniconda&lt;/a>
and see that a handful of roles for installing Miniconda exist. I liked &lt;a class="link" href="https://galaxy.ansible.com/andrewrothstein/miniconda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this
one&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can install the role locally using the &lt;code>ansible-galaxy&lt;/code> command line tool.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ansible-galaxy install -f andrewrothstein.miniconda
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>You can have the role installed wherever you want (run &lt;code>ansible-galaxy install --help&lt;/code> to see how, but by default they&amp;rsquo;ll go to
&lt;code>/usr/local/etc/ansible/roles/&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>You can look at the &lt;code>tasks/main.yml&lt;/code> to see the core logic of installing
Miniconda. It has tasks to download the installer, run the installer, delete
the installer, run &lt;code>conda update conda&lt;/code>, and make &lt;code>conda&lt;/code> the default system
Python.&lt;/p>

&lt;h3 id="overriding-ansible-variables">Overriding Ansible Variables
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Once a role is installed locally, you can add it to a play just like you can
with roles you wrote. Installing Miniconda is now as simple as:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> roles:
- role: andrewrothstein.miniconda
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>Before we add that to a playbook, I want to customize &lt;em>where&lt;/em> miniconda is
installed. If you look back at the &lt;code>main.yml&lt;/code> file above, you see a bunch of
things surrounded in double brackets. These are variables (in the &lt;a class="link" href="http://jinja.pocoo.org/docs/2.9/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jinja2
template language&lt;/a>). From the play, we can
see that Miniconda will be installed at
&lt;code>{{miniconda_parent_dir}}/{{miniconda_name}}&lt;/code>. The role defines these
variables in &lt;code>/andrewrothstein.miniconda/defaults/main.yml&lt;/code>. We can override
the default variables by specifying them in our play.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A play to install miniconda could look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>---
- hosts: digitalocean
vars:
conda_folder_name: miniconda
conda_root: /root
roles:
- role: andrewrothstein.miniconda
miniconda_parent_dir: &amp;quot;{{ conda_root }}&amp;quot;
miniconda_name: &amp;quot;{{ conda_folder_name }}&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I added this to
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/tdhopper/automating_python/blob/master/playbook.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>playbook.yml&lt;/code>&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We now know how to use Ansible to start and run supervisord and to install
Miniconda. Let&amp;rsquo;s see how to use it to deploy and start our application.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="deploy-python-application">Deploy Python Application
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>There are countless ways to deploy a Python application. We&amp;rsquo;re going to see
how to use Ansible to deploy from Github.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a little project called
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/tdhopper/long_running_python_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>long_running_python_application&lt;/a>.
It has a
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/tdhopper/long_running_python_process/blob/master/main.py" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>main.py&lt;/code>&lt;/a>
that writes a log line to stdout every 30 seconds; that&amp;rsquo;s it. It also includes
a &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/tdhopper/long_running_python_process/blob/master/environment.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Conda environment
file&lt;/a>
specifying the dependencies and &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/tdhopper/long_running_python_process/blob/master/run.sh" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>a shell
script&lt;/a>
that activates the environment and runs the program.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We&amp;rsquo;re going to use Ansible to&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Clone the repository into our remote machine.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Conda environment based on the environment.yml file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a supervisord file for running the program.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start the supervisord job.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;h3 id="clone-the-repository">Clone the repository
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Cloning a repository with Ansible is easy. We just use the &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/git_module.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>git&lt;/code>
module&lt;/a>. This play will clone
the repo into the specified directory. The &lt;code>update: yes&lt;/code> flag tells Ansible to
update the repository from the remote if it has already been cloned.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>---
- hosts: digitalocean
vars:
project_repo: git://github.com/tdhopper/long_running_python_process.git
project_location: /srv/long_running_python_process
tasks:
- name: Clone project code.
git:
repo: &amp;quot;{{ project_repo }}&amp;quot;
dest: &amp;quot;{{ project_location }}&amp;quot;
update: yes
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="creating-the-conda-environment">Creating the Conda Environment
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Since we&amp;rsquo;ve now installed conda and cloned the repository with an
&lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> file, we just need to run &lt;code>conda env update&lt;/code> from the
directory containing the environment spec. Here&amp;rsquo;s a play to do that:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>---
- hosts: digitalocean
vars:
project_location: /srv/long_running_python_process
tasks:
- name: Create Conda environment from project environment file.
command: &amp;quot;{{conda_root}}/{{conda_folder_name}}/bin/conda env update&amp;quot;
args:
chdir: &amp;quot;{{ project_location }}&amp;quot;
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>It uses the &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/command_module.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>command&lt;/code>
module&lt;/a> which just
executes a shell command in the desired directory.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="create-a-supervisord-file">Create a Supervisord File
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>By default, supervisord will &lt;a class="link" href="http://supervisord.org/configuration.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>look in &lt;code>/etc/supervisor/conf.d/&lt;/code> for
configuration&lt;/a> on which programs to
run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We need to put a file in there that tells supervisord to run our &lt;code>run.sh&lt;/code>
script. Ansible has an integrated way of setting up templates which can be
placed on remote machines.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I put a supervisord job template in the &lt;code>./templates&lt;/code> folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>cat ./templates/run_process.j2
cat ./templates/run_process.j2
[program:{{ program_name }}]
command=sh run.sh
autostart=true
directory={{ project_location }}
stderr_logfile=/var/log/{{ program_name }}.err.log
stdout_logfile=/var/log/{{ program_name }}.out.log
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>This is a is normal INI-style config file, except it includes Jinja2
variables. We can use the Ansible &lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/template_module.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>template&lt;/code>
module&lt;/a> to create a task
which fills in the variables with information about our program and copies it
into the &lt;code>conf.d&lt;/code> folder on the remote machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The play for this would look like:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>- hosts: digitalocean
vars:
project_location: /srv/long_running_python_process
program_name: long_running_process
supervisord_configs_path: /etc/supervisor/conf.d
tasks:
- name: Copy supervisord job file to remote
template:
src: ./templates/run_process.j2
dest: &amp;quot;{{ supervisord_configs_path }}/run_process.conf&amp;quot;
owner: root
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;h3 id="start-the-supevisord-job">Start the supevisord job
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Finally, we just need to tell supervisord on our remote machine to start the
job described by &lt;code>run_process.conf&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of issuing our own shell commands via Ansible, we can use the
&lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/supervisorctl_module.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>supervisorctl&lt;/code>
module&lt;/a>. The task
is just:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code> - name: Start job
supervisorctl:
name: &amp;quot;{{ program_name }}&amp;quot;
state: present
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>&lt;code>state: present&lt;/code> ensures that Ansible calls &lt;code>supervisorctl reread&lt;/code> to load a
new config. Because our config has &lt;code>autostart=true&lt;/code>, supervisor will start it
as soon as the task is added.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="the-big-playbook">The Big Playbook!
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>We can take everything we&amp;rsquo;ve described above and put it in one playbook.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This playbook will:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Install Miniconda using the role from Ansible Galaxy.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Install and start Supervisor using the role we created.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Clone the Github project we want to run.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a Conda environment based on the environment.yml file.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a supervisord file for running the program.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Start the supervisord job.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>All of this will be done on the host we specify (&lt;code>digitalocean&lt;/code>).&lt;/p>

&lt;p>See that the &lt;code>PLAY RECAP&lt;/code> shows that everything was OK, no systems were
unreachable, and no tasks failed.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can verify that the program is running without error:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>ssh digitalocean sudo supervisorctl status
ssh digitalocean sudo supervisorctl status

INFO:root:Process ran for the 4th time
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If your lucky (i.e. your systems and networks were setup sufficiently similar
to mine), you can run this exact same command to configure and start a process
on your own system. Moreover, you could use this exact same command to start
this program on an arbitrary number of machines by simply adding more hosts to
your inventory and play spec!&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Ansible is a powerful, customizable tool. Unlike some similar tools, it
requires very little setup to start using it. As I&amp;rsquo;ve learned more about it,
I&amp;rsquo;ve seen more and more ways in which I could&amp;rsquo;ve used it in copious projects
in the past; I intend to make it a regular part of my toolkit. (Historically
I&amp;rsquo;ve done this kind of thing with hacky combinations of shell scripts and
&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.fabfile.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fabric&lt;/a>; Ansible would often be better.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This tutorial just scratches the surface of the Ansible functionality. If you
want to learn more, I again recommend reading through the
&lt;a class="link" href="http://docs.ansible.com/ansible/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>docs&lt;/a>; they&amp;rsquo;re very good. Of
course, you should start writing and running your own playbooks as soon as
possible! I also liked &lt;a class="link" href="https://serversforhackers.com/an-ansible-tutorial" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this tutorial from Server Admin for
Programmers&lt;/a>. If you want
to compare Ansible to alternatives, the &lt;a class="link" href="https://valdhaus.co/books/taste-test-puppet-chef-salt-stack-ansible.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Taste Test book&lt;/a> by Matt Jaynes looks promising. For more on Supervisor,

>serversforhackers.com&lt;/a> has a nice tutorial, and &lt;a class="link" href="http://supervisord.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>👉 The decision was close, but the team has decided to keep looking for
someone who might have more direct neural net experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>👉 Honestly, I think the way you communicated your thought process and
results was confusing for some people in the room.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>👉 He&amp;rsquo;s needing someone with an image analysis background for data scientist
we&amp;rsquo;re hiring now.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>👉 Quite honestly given your questions [about vacation policy] and the fact
that you are considering other options, [we] may not be the best choice for
you.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>These quotes above are some of the reasons I&amp;rsquo;ve been given for why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t
offered a data science job after interviewing. I&amp;rsquo;ve been told a variety of
other reasons as well: company decided against hiring remotes after
interviewing (I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this at least 3 times), company thought I changed
jobs too frequently, company decided it didn&amp;rsquo;t have necessary data
infrastructure in place for data science work. Multiple companies gave no
particular reason; some of these were at least kind enough to &lt;em>notify me&lt;/em> they
weren&amp;rsquo;t interested. One company hired someone with a Ph.D. from MIT soon after
turning me down.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the last five years, I&amp;rsquo;ve clearly interviewed for a lot of data science
jobs, and I&amp;rsquo;ve also been &lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/rejected" >turned down for a lot of data science
jobs&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve spent a good bit of time reflecting
on why I wasn&amp;rsquo;t offered this job or that. Several folks have asked me if I had
any advice to share on the experience, and I hope to offer that here.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="you-never-really-know">You never really know
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I learned with graduate school applications years ago: you rarely truly know
why you were turned down. Maybe my GRE scores weren&amp;rsquo;t high enough, or maybe
the reviewer rushed through my application in the 5 minutes before lunch.
Maybe my statement of interest was too weak, or maybe the department needed to
accept an alumni&amp;rsquo;s child.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The same goes for companies. I&amp;rsquo;m fairly skeptical that the reasons I have been
given for why I was passed by are the full story, and I suspect you will
rarely (if ever) know the real reasons why you weren&amp;rsquo;t offered a job. I try to
use the reasons I hear as a way to help me refine my skills and better present
myself, but I don&amp;rsquo;t put too much weight in them.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="some-advice-anyway">Some advice anyway
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>That said, here are a few takeaways from interviewing for probably 20 data
science jobs since 2012.&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Companies often use interviews as a time to figure out what they&amp;rsquo;re really looking for.&lt;/strong> I suspect this is rarely intentional. But actually interviewing candidates forces a team to talk through what they&amp;rsquo;re actually looking for, and they often realize they had differing perspectives prior to the interview.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Companies where &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; is a new addition need your help in understanding what data science can do for them.&lt;/strong> As much as possible, use the interview to sell your vision for what data science can offer at the company, how you&amp;rsquo;ll get it off the ground, and what the ROI might be.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Being the wrong fit for what a company needs is not ideal.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;ve come to appreciate a company trying to ensure my abilities align with their needs. You&amp;rsquo;d hope this was &lt;em>always&lt;/em> the case, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been hired when it wasn&amp;rsquo;t. That said, I hesitate to say you should always look for this: if you need a job, and someone offers you a job, you should feel free to take it!&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Data infrastructure is important and many companies are lacking it.&lt;/strong> Many data scientists can attest to being hired at a company only to discover the data they needed wasn&amp;rsquo;t available, and they spent months or years building the tools required for them to start their analysis. Many companies are naive about how much engineering effort is required for effective data science. Don&amp;rsquo;t assume that a company with a grand vision for data science necessarily knows what it will take to accomplish that vision.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Many companies are still uneasy about data science being done remotely.&lt;/strong> I think this is silly, but I&amp;rsquo;m biased.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>There&amp;rsquo;s little consistency as to what you might be asked in a data science interview.&lt;/strong> I&amp;rsquo;ve been asked about Java design patterns, how to solve combinatorics problems, to describe my favorite machine learning model, to explain the &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sequential_minimal_optimization" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>SMO algorithm&lt;/a>, my opinions about the TensorFlow API, how I do software testing, to analyze a never-before-seen dataset and prepare a presentation in a 4 hour window, the list goes on. I spent a flight to the west coast reading up on the statistics of A/B testing only to be asked largely soft-skills type questions for an entire interview. I&amp;rsquo;ve largely given up attempting any special preparation for interviews.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;strong>Networking is still king.&lt;/strong> Hiring is hard, and interviewing is hard; having a prior relationship with an applicant is attractive and reduces hiring uncertainty. In my own experience, my friendships and connections with the data science community on Twitter has &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/760109403383144448" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>shaped my career&lt;/a>. Don&amp;rsquo;t downplay the benefits of networking.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>So how do you get a data science job? I don&amp;rsquo;t know.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve been unbelievably fortunate to be continuously employed since college,
but I&amp;rsquo;m not sure how to tell you to repeat that. The best I have to offer is
to reiterate the conclusion of &lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/blog/how-i-quit-my-ph.d.-and-learned-to-love-data-science/" >my recent talk about data science as a career&lt;/a>. Learn and know the hard stuff: linear algebra, probability,
statistics, machine learning, math modeling, data structures, algorithms,
distributed systems, etc. You probably won&amp;rsquo;t use this knowledge every day in
your job, but interviewers love to ask about it anyway.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>At the same time, don&amp;rsquo;t forget about the even harder skills: communication,
careful thought, prose writing skill, software writing skill, software
engineering, tenacity, Stack Overflow. You will use these every day in your
job, and they&amp;rsquo;ll help you present yourself well in an interview. (With the
exception of Stack Overflow. Using Stack Overflow in an interview is strangely
taboo.)&lt;/p>

>fantastic recap&lt;/a> of his experience.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>His &amp;ldquo;list of things I&amp;rsquo;ve discovered over the years&amp;rdquo; is particularly good. Here are a few of the things that resonated with me:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;li> The more you can work with someone to help refine their question the easier it will be to answer
&lt;li> Conducting a randomized controlled experiment via an A/B test is always better than analyzing historical data
&lt;li> Metrics are crucial to the story a company tells itself; it is essential to honestly and rigorously define them
&lt;li> Good experimental design is difficult; don't allow a great testing framework to let you get lazy with it
&lt;li> Data science (A/B testing, etc.) can help you how to optimize for a particular outcome, but it will never tell you which particular outcome to optimize for
&lt;li> Always seek to record and attain data in its rawest form, whether you're instrumenting something yourself or retrieving it from an API

&lt;p>I was an adept, as a teenager and a young adult, of thinkism. Thinkism is the idea that intelligence alone can solve problems. I thought I was smart so that I could just sit down and solve important problems. One after the other. Whatever contributions I ended up making had little to do with sitting down and thinking hard… and much more to do with getting dirty.&lt;/p>

>pykafka&lt;/a> library with an optional c-backed using &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>rdkafka&lt;/a>. I&amp;rsquo;ve had trouble getting it to work, and here are a few things I&amp;rsquo;ve learned:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>The version of rdkafka installable with apt-get was out of data, and pykafka couldn&amp;rsquo;t find the headers it need. I instead used the simple &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/edenhill/librdkafka#building" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>build instructions&lt;/a> in the rdkafka README to build it from head.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>I was getting the error &lt;code>ImportError: librdkafka.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory&lt;/code> when trying to use rdkafka from Pykafka. It could be set in the short term by using &lt;code>LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/local/lib&lt;/code>. However, I fixed it permanently by running &lt;a class="link" href="https://linux.die.net/man/8/ldconfig" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>&lt;code>sudo ldconfig&lt;/code>&lt;/a> after building rdkafka.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Pykafka has to be installed &lt;em>after&lt;/em> building rdkafka. At the moment, Pykafka tries to build a C-extension to connect to rdkafka, and if that fails, it will install without offering the rdkafka backend. Check the output of &lt;code>pip install pykafka&lt;/code> &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/Parsely/pykafka/blob/1b946fa288dd5eb278f397e858e887146e048e47/setup.py#L164-L172" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>To run my service or scripts, I open a &lt;a class="link" href="https://tmux.github.io/" title="tmux"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>tmux&lt;/a>
window, activate my virtual environement, and start the process. (When I have
to do this on multiple machines, I&amp;rsquo;m occasionally clever enough to use tmux to
broadcast the commands to multiple terminal windows.)&lt;/p>
&lt;p>When I need to check my logs or see the output, I SSH back into each box,
reconnect to tmux (after I remember the name of my session), and tail my logs.
When running on multiple boxes, I repeat this process N times. If I need to
restart a process, I flip through my tmux tabs until I find the correct
process, kill it with a Ctrl-C, and use the up arrow to reload the last run
command.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>All of this works, of course. &lt;a class="link" href="https://xkcd.com/1319/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>And as we all know&lt;/a>, &lt;a class="link" href="http://xkcd.com/974/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

simple solution that works&lt;/a> &lt;a class="link" href="https://xkcd.com/1445/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>can be
preferable&lt;/a> to a fragile solution that requires
constant maintenance. That said, I suspect many of us aren&amp;rsquo;t lazy enough. We
don&amp;rsquo;t spend enough time automating tasks and processes. Even when we don&amp;rsquo;t
save time by doing it, we may save &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/22/automate-to-save-mental-energy-not-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>mental overhead&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently introduced several colleagues to some Python-based tools that can
help. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.fabfile.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fabric&lt;/a> is a &amp;ldquo;library and command-line tool
for streamlining the use of SSH for application deployment or systems
administration tasks.&amp;rdquo; Fabric allows you to encapsulate sequences of commands
as you might with a Makefile. It&amp;rsquo;s killer feature is the ease with which it
lets you execute those commands on remote machines over SSH. With Fabric, you
could tail all the logs on all your nodes with a single command executed in
your local terminal. There are &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=python&amp;#43;fabric" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>a number of talks about Fabric on
Youtube&lt;/a> if you
want to learn more. One of my colleagues reduced his daily workload by writing
his system management tasks into a Fabric file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Another great tool is &lt;a class="link" href="http://supervisord.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Supervisor&lt;/a>. If you run long
running processes in tmux/screen/nohup, Supervisor might be for you. It allows
you to define the tasks you want to run in an INI file and &amp;ldquo;provides you with
one place to start, stop, and monitor your processes&amp;rdquo;. Supervisor will log the
stdout and stderr to a log location of your choice. It can be a little
confusing to set up, but will likely make your life easier in the longer run.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A tool I want to learn but haven&amp;rsquo;t is &lt;a class="link" href="https://www.ansible.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ansible&lt;/a>, &amp;ldquo;a
free-software platform for configuring and managing computers which combines
multi-node software deployment, ad hoc task execution, and configuration
management&amp;rdquo;. Unlike Chef and Puppet, Ansible doesn&amp;rsquo;t require an agent on the
systems you need to configure; it does all the configuration over SSH. You can
use Ansible to configure your systems and install your dependencies, even
&lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/zenoamaro/ansible-supervisord" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Supervisor&lt;/a>! Ansible is
written in Python and, mercifully, doesn&amp;rsquo;t require learning a Ruby-based DSL
(as does Chef).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking that Fabric, Supervisor, and Ansible combined
become a powerful toolset for management and configuration of data science
systems. Each tool is also open source and can be installed in a few minutes.
Each tool is well documented and offers helpful tutorials on getting started;
however, learning to use them effectively may require some effort.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I would love to see someone create training materials on these tools (and
others!) focused on how data scientists can take improve their system
management, configuration, and operations. A screencast series may be the
perfect thing. Someone please help data scientists be lazier, do less work,
and reduce the mental overhead of dealing with computers!&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Filter by date in a Pandas MultiIndex</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/filter-by-date-in-a-pandas-multiindex/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Nov 2016 22:17:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/filter-by-date-in-a-pandas-multiindex/</guid><description>&lt;p>I always forget how to do this.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>If you get an error like &lt;code>KeyError: 'Key length (1) was greater than MultiIndex lexsort depth (0)'&lt;/code>, it&amp;rsquo;s because &amp;ldquo;MultiIndex Slicing requires the
index to be fully lexsorted&amp;rdquo;.

Here&amp;rsquo;s the description:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Latent Dirichlet Allocation and related topic models are often presented in the form of complicated equations and confusing diagrams. Tim Hopper presents LDA as a generative model through probabilistic simulation in simple Python. Simulation will help data scientists to understand the model assumptions and limitations and more effectively use black box LDA implementations.&lt;/p>

Claude Shannon asked the question&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Can we find a measure of how much &amp;ldquo;choice&amp;rdquo; is involved in the selection of the event or of how uncertain we are of the outcome?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>For example, suppose we have a coin that lands on heads with probability \(p\) and tails with probability \(1-p\). If \(p=1\), the coin always lands on heads. Since there is no uncertainty, we might want to say the uncertainty is 0. However, if the coin is fair and \(p=0.5\), we maximize our uncertainty: it&amp;rsquo;s a complete tossup whether the coin is heads or tails. We might want to say the uncertainty in this case is 1.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In general, Shannon wanted to devise a function \(H(p_1, p_2, \ldots, p_n)\) describing the uncertainty of an arbitrary set of discrete events (i.e. a \(n\)-sided die). He thought that &amp;ldquo;it is reasonable&amp;rdquo; that \(H\) should have three properties:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>\(H\) should be a continuous function of each \(p_i\). A small change in a single probability should result in a similarly small entropy (uncertainty) change.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>If each event is equally likely (\(p_i=\frac{1}{n}\)), \(H\) should increase as a function of \(n\): the more events there are, the more uncertain we are.&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li>
&lt;p>Finally, entropy should be additive for independent events. Suppose we generate a random variable \(x\) by the following process: Flip a fair coin. If it is heads, \(x=0\). However, if the flip was tails, flip the coin again (an &lt;em>independent&lt;/em> event from the first flip). If the second flip is heads, \(x=1\), if tails \(x=2\). These three outcomes occur with probability $1/2$, $1/4$, and $1/4$, respectively.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We can compute the entropy of $x$ as \(H(p_0=1/2, p_1=1/4, p_2=1/4)\). By the independence property, this relationship holds:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[H\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{4}, \frac{1}{4}\right)=H\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right) + \frac{1}{2} H\left(\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{2}\right).\]&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.inference.phy.cam.ac.uk/itprnn/book.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>David MacKay explains&lt;/a>, this is the general claim that&lt;/p>
&lt;p>\[ H(\mathbf{p})=H(p_1, 1-p_1)+(1-p_1)H\left(\frac{p_2}{1-p_1}, \frac{p_3}{1-p_1}, \ldots, \frac{p_n}{1-p_1}\right).\]&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Shannon showed that given these three assumptions, there is a unique form that \(H\) must take:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ H\propto -\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log p_i=\sum_{i=1}^n p_i \log \frac{1}{p_i}. $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>He named this measure of uncertainty &lt;em>entropy&lt;/em>, because the form of \(H\) bears striking similarity to that of &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy_%28statistical_thermodynamics%29#Gibbs_Entropy_Formula" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Gibbs Entropy&lt;/a> in statistical thermodynamics.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Shannon observes that \(H\) has many other interesting properties:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Entropy \(H\) is 0 if and only if exactly one event has probability 1 and the rest have probability 0. (Uncertainty vanishes only when we are certain about the outcomes.)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Entropy \(H\) is maximized when the \(p_i\) values are equal.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>The joint entropy of two events is less than or equal to the sum of the individual entropies. \(H(x, y)=H(x)+H(y)\) only when \(x\) and \(y\) are independent events.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>You should call it entropy, for two reasons. In the first place your uncertainty function has been used in statistical mechanics under that name, so it already has a name. In the second place, and more important, nobody knows what entropy really is, so in a debate you will always have the advantage.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>They argue that the name &amp;ldquo;uncertainty&amp;rdquo; would have been much more helpful since &amp;ldquo;Shannon entropy is simply and avowedly the &amp;lsquo;measure of the uncertainty inherient in a pre-assigned probability scheme.&amp;rsquo;&amp;rdquo;&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

>As we saw in an earlier post&lt;/a>, the entropy of a discrete probability distribution is defined to be&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$H(p)=H(p_1,p_2,\ldots,p_n)=-\sum_{i}p_i \log p_i.$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Kullback and Leibler defined a similar measure now known as &lt;em>KL divergence&lt;/em>. This measure quantifies how similar a probability distribution $p$ is to a candidate distribution $q$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$D_{\text{KL}}(p\ | q)=\sum_i p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i}.$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$D_\text{KL}$ is non-negative and zero if and only if $ p_i = q_i $ for all $i$. However, it is important to note that it is not in general symmetric:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ D_{\text{KL}}(p| q) \neq D_{\text{KL}}(q| p).$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://arxiv.org/pdf/1404.2000v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jonathon Shlens explains&lt;/a> that KL Divergence can be interpreted as measuring the likelihood that samples represented by the empirical distribution $p$ were generated by a fixed distribution $q$. If $D_{\text{KL}}(p| q)=0$, we can guarantee that $p$ is generated by $q$. As $D_{\text{KL}}(p| q)\rightarrow\infty$, we can say that it is increasingly unlikely that $p$ was generated by $q$.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Algebraically, we can rewrite the definition as&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$ \begin{array}{rl} D_{\text{KL}}(p| q) &amp;amp;=\sum_i p_i \log \frac{p_i}{q_i} \\ &amp;amp;=\sum_i \left ( - p_i \log q_i + p_i \log p_i \right)\\ &amp;amp;=- \sum_i p_i \log q_i + \sum_i p_i \log p_i \\ &amp;amp;=- \sum_i p_i \log q_i - \sum_i p_i \log \frac{1}{p_i} \\ &amp;amp;=- \sum_i p_i \log q_i-H(p) \\ &amp;amp;=\sum_i p_i \log \frac{1}{q_i}-H(p)\\ \end{array} $$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>KL Divergence breaks down as something that looks similar to entropy (but combining $p$ and $q$) minus the entropy of $p$. This first term is often called &lt;em>cross entropy&lt;/em>:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$H(p, q)=\sum_i p_i \log \frac{1}{q_i}.$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>We could alternatively use this relationship to define cross entropy as:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$H(p, q)=H(p) + D_\text{KL}(p| q).$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Intuitively, the cross entropy is the uncertainty implicit in $H(p)$ plus the likelihood that $p$ could have be generated by $q$. If we consider $p$ to be a fixed distribution, $H(p, q)$ and $D_\text{KL}(p | q)$ differ by a constant factor for all $q$.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Photos Featured on Smithsonian Magazine</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/photos-featured-on-smithsonian-magazine/</link><pubDate>Mon, 25 Jul 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/photos-featured-on-smithsonian-magazine/</guid><description>&lt;p>A few weeks ago, I introduced my wife to backpacking in the beautiful &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.dcr.virginia.gov/state-parks/grayson-highlands" title="Grayson Highlands State Park"

&lt;p>Today I learned how to filter the results by files changed in the last N minutes: the &lt;code>cmin&lt;/code> flag:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1

&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> -cmin [-|+]n
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> True if the difference between the time of last change of file

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl"> exactly n minutes ago.
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>For example:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1

&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">find . -cmin +5 # Files modified more than 5 minutes ago
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">find . -cmin -5 # Files modified less than than 5 minutes ago

>remote machine&lt;/a> and want the results to save to a CSV file on that machine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently realized that I should setup an Impala config file on that machine to configure the connection to the Impala cluster and the output file format.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>So I created a text file at &lt;code>~/.impalarc&lt;/code> with the following settings:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">

&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">3
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">4
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">5
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">6
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">7
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">8

&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">[impala]
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">impalad=CLUSTER-ADDRESS:PORT
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">output_delimiter=,
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">verbose=true
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">ignore_query_failure=false
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">default_db=prd
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">write_delimited=true
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">print_header=true
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now when I run a query with &lt;code>impala-shell&lt;/code>, I don&amp;rsquo;t have to specify the address of the cluster, or the various flags required to get a CSV with a header.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Other impala-shell config options are specified &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cloudera.com/documentation/archive/impala/2-x/2-0-x/topics/impala_shell_options.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>Now I can connect to the machine by typing &lt;code>$ ssh lab&lt;/code>. That&amp;rsquo;s it. I don&amp;rsquo;t have to provide the SSH key, username, or machine IP.&lt;/p>

than it appears. In R, you just use the &lt;code>cbind&lt;/code> function.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As &lt;a class="link" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/33088010/pandas-column-bind-cbind-two-data-frames" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>this&lt;/a> StackOverflow question shows, in Pandas it&amp;rsquo;s easy to
end up with something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">2
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">3
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">4
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">5
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">6
&lt;/span>&lt;span class="lnt">7
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">unique_id lacet_number latitude longitude
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">0 NaN NaN -93.193560 31.217029
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">1 NaN NaN -93.948082 35.360874
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">2 NaN NaN -103.131508 37.787609
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">15 5570613 TLA-0138365 NaN NaN
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">24 5025490 EMP-0138757 NaN NaN
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">36 4354431 DXN-0025343 NaN NaN
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>This results from the indices not being identical. Frustratingly (to me) the
&lt;code>ignore_index&lt;/code> argument doesn&amp;rsquo;t give the 3-rowed DataFrame I&amp;rsquo;d hope it gives.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As the &lt;a class="link" href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/33088410/982745" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

question shows, the thing to do is reset the indices on the DataFrames before
concatenating:&lt;/p>

a cell. It renders the HTML version of the data frame returned by
&lt;code>pandas.DataFrame.to_html()&lt;/code>. However, if you call &lt;code>print(df)&lt;/code> in a cell, the
data frame is rendered in less readable text-based output.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Despite using Notebooks regularly for years, I&amp;rsquo;d never bothered to figure out
a way around this. However, the solution is easy.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead of &lt;code>print(df)&lt;/code> you use&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In January of 1616, the month before before the Roman Inquisition would infamously condemn the Copernican theory as being &amp;ldquo;foolish and absurd in philosophy&amp;rdquo;, Monsignor Francesco Ingoli addressed Galileo Galilei with an essay entitled &amp;ldquo;Disputation concerning the location and rest of Earth against the system of Copernicus&amp;rdquo;. &amp;hellip; The essay, upon which the Inquisition condemnation was likely based, lists mathematical, physical, and theological arguments against the Copernican theory. Ingoli asks Galileo to respond to those mathematical and physical arguments that are &amp;ldquo;more weighty&amp;rdquo;, and does not ask him to respond to the theological arguments at all. &amp;hellip; Ingoli&amp;rsquo;s emphasis on the scientific arguments of Brahe, and his lack of emphasis on theological arguments, raises the question of whether the condemnation of the Copernican theory was, in contrast to how it is usually viewed, essentially scientific in nature, following the ideas of Brahe.&lt;/p>

their scripts. There are several good reasons to stop using the system Python.
First, it&amp;rsquo;s probably an old version of Python. Secondly, if you install 3rd
party packages with &lt;a class="link" href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/pip" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>pip&lt;/a>, every package is
installed into the same globally accessible directory. While this may sound
convenient, it causes problems if you (1) install different packages with the
same name (2) need to use different versions of the same package (3) upgrade
your operating system (OS X will delete all the packages you have installed).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For many years, best practice for Python developers was to use virtualenv to
create a sandbox-ed environment for each project. If you use virtualenv, each
project you work on can have its own version of Python with its own 3rd party
packages (hopefully specified in an &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> file). In my
experience, getting started with virtualenv is cumbersome and confusing; to
this day, I have to look up the command to create a Python 3 virtualenv.
virtualenv also provides no helping in actually managing Python versions. You
have to install each version yourself and then tell virtualenv to use it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In 2015, I have almost exclusively used Python installations provided through
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.continuum.io/" title="Continuum"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Continuum Analytics&amp;rsquo;s&lt;/a>
&lt;a class="link" href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html" title="Intro to conda —
Conda documentation"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Conda/Anaconda&lt;/a> platform. I have also switched from using virtualenvs
to using &lt;a class="link" href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/using/envs.html" title="Managing environments — Conda documentation"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>conda environments&lt;/a>, and I am loving it.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Before explaining my workflow, here&amp;rsquo;s a quick glossary of the similarly-named
products that Continuum offers.&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="http://conda.pydata.org/docs/intro.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>conda&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;Conda is an open source package management system and environment management system for installing multiple versions of software packages and their dependencies and switching easily between them. It works on Linux, OS X and Windows, and was &lt;em>created for Python programs but can package and distribute any software.&lt;/em> &amp;quot; A conda install provides a whole suite of command line tools for installing and managing packages and environments. Because conda works for any software, it can even install different versions of Python (unlike pip).&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Anaconda&lt;/a>: &amp;ldquo;Anaconda is a completely free Python distribution (including for commercial use and redistribution). It includes more than 300 of the most popular Python packages for science, math, engineering, and data analysis.&amp;rdquo; It is available across platforms and installable through a binary.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>&lt;a class="link" href="https://anaconda.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Anaconda Cloud&lt;/a>: Also known as Anaconda.org and formerly known as Binstar, &amp;ldquo;Anaconda Cloud is a package management service where you can host software packages of all kinds.&amp;rdquo; Anaconda Cloud is a package repository analogous to PyPI. Packages are installed via the conda command line tool instead of Pip. By default, the &lt;code>conda install&lt;/code> command installs packages from a curated collection of packages (a superset of those in Anaconda). Continuum allows users to host their own packages on Anaconda Cloud; these packages can also be installed through &lt;code>conda install&lt;/code> using the &lt;code>-n&lt;/code> flag with the username.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>Conda, Anaconda, and Anaconda cloud are distinct but interrelated tools;
keeping them straight can be hard, but is helpful.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conda (the package manager) can be installed in two ways. Through the
&lt;a class="link" href="http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Miniconda&lt;/a> installer or the
&lt;a class="link" href="https://www.continuum.io/downloads" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Anaconda&lt;/a> installer. Both install the
package manager, but the latter also installs the 300+ packages for scientific
Python. (Installing Anaconda is equivalent to installing Miniconda and then
running &lt;code>conda install anaconda&lt;/code>.)&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conda-environment-files">Conda Environment Files
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>It has become standard for pip users to create a &lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> file for
specifying dependencies for a particular project. Often, a developer working a
project will (1) create and activate a virtual environment (2) run &lt;code>pip install -r requirements.txt&lt;/code> to build an isolated development environment with
the needed packages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Conda provides an analogous (but more powerful) file: &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A simple &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> file might look like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>name: numpy-env
dependencies:
- python=3
- numpy
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>If you are in a directory containing this file, you can run &lt;code>$ conda env create&lt;/code> to create a Conda environment named &lt;code>numpy-env&lt;/code> that runs Python 3 and
has &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.numpy.org/" title="NumPy — Numpy"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>numpy&lt;/a> installed[^numpy]. Run &lt;code>$ source activate numpy-env&lt;/code> to activate this environment. Once activated,
running &lt;code>$ python&lt;/code> will run Python 3 from your environment instead of the
globally installed Python for your system. Moreover, you will be able to
&lt;code>import numpy&lt;/code> but not any of the 3rd party packages installed globally.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> can also install packages via pip with this syntax:&lt;/p>
&lt;pre>&lt;code>name: pip-env
dependencies:
- python
- pip
- pip:
- pypi-package-name
&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>
&lt;p>I see &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> files as a positive development from
&lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> files for several reasons. Foremost, they allow you to
specify the version of Python you want to use. At Pydata NYC 2015, many
presenters provided their code in Github repositories without specifying
anywhere whether they were using Python 2 or 3. Because I &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/tdhopper/pydata-nyc-2015/blob/55b9d2892b18e1d191325fc1890740901723dcfd/environment.yml" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>included a YAML file&lt;/a>,
attendees could see exactly what version I was using and quickly install it
with &lt;code>conda env create&lt;/code>. I also like being able to specify the name of the
environment in the file; this is particularly helpful when working with
others. Finally, because conda can install from PyPI via pip,
&lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> files provide no less functionality than a
&lt;code>requirements.txt&lt;/code> file provides.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="my-python-environment-workflow">My Python Environment Workflow
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Lately, whenever I am working on a new project (however big or small), I
follow the following steps:&lt;/p>
&lt;ol>
&lt;li>Create a project folder in the &lt;code>~/repos/&lt;/code> directory on my computer.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create an &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> file in the directory. Typically the environment name will be the same as the folder name. At minimum, it will specify the version of Python I want to use; it will often include &lt;code>anaconda&lt;/code> as a dependency.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create the conda environment with &lt;code>$ conda env create&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Activate the conda environment with &lt;code>$ source activate ENV_NAME&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Create a &lt;code>.env&lt;/code> file containing the line &lt;code>source activate ENV_NAME&lt;/code>. Because I have &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/kennethreitz/autoenv" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>autoenv&lt;/a> installed, this file will be run every time I navigate to the project folder in the Terminal. Therefore, my conda environment will be activated as soon as I navigate to the folder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Run &lt;code>$ git init&lt;/code> to make the folder a Git repository. I then run &lt;code>$ git add environment.yml &amp;amp;&amp;amp; git commit -m 'initial commit'&lt;/code> to add the YAML file to the repository.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>If I want to push the repository to Github, I use &lt;code>$ git create&lt;/code> using Github&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/github/hub" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>hub&lt;/a> commands. I then push the master branch with &lt;code>$ git push -u origin master&lt;/code>.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ol>
&lt;p>As I add dependencies to my project, I try to be sure I add them to my
&lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A major benefit of all this is how easily reproducible a development
environment becomes. If a colleague or conference attendee wants to run my
code, they can setup the dependencies ( &lt;em>including&lt;/em> Python version) by (1)
cloning the repository, (2) running &lt;code>$ conda env create&lt;/code>, (3) running &lt;code>$ source activate ENV_NAME&lt;/code>. It&amp;rsquo;s easy enough for me to drop those instructions
and further instructions for running the code in a README file. If I&amp;rsquo;m feeling
especially helpful, I&amp;rsquo;ll create a
&lt;a class="link" href="http://mrbook.org/blog/tutorials/make/" title="Makefiles – Mrbook&amp;#39;s
Stuff"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Makefile&lt;/a> or &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.fabfile.org/" title="Welcome to Fabric! — Fabric
documentation"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Fabfile&lt;/a> to encapsulate commands for core functionality of the code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An even larger benefit is that I can return to a project after, days, months,
or years and quickly start developing without first having to hunt for &lt;code>print&lt;/code>
statements to figure out whether I was using Python 2 or 3.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve come to love &lt;code>environment.yml&lt;/code> files, and I think you might too.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Sequential Minimal Optimization Algorithm for Support Vector Machines</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/sequential-minimal-optimization-algorithm-for-support-vector-machines/</link><pubDate>Sat, 21 Nov 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/sequential-minimal-optimization-algorithm-for-support-vector-machines/</guid><description>&lt;p>In my nonlinear optimization class in grad school at North Carolina State University, I wrote a paper on the famed SMO algorithm for support vector machines.

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Marketing and use of electronic cigarettes (e-cigarettes) and other electronic nicotine delivery devices have increased exponentially in recent years fueled, in part, by marketing and word-of-mouth communications via social media platforms, such as Twitter. &amp;hellip; We identified approximately 1.7 million tweets about e-cigarettes between 2008 and 2013, with the majority of these tweets being advertising (93.43%, 1,559,508/1,669,123). Tweets about e-cigarettes increased more than tenfold between 2009 and 2010, suggesting a rapid increase in the popularity of e-cigarettes and marketing efforts. The Twitter handles tweeting most frequently about e-cigarettes were a mixture of e-cigarette brands, affiliate marketers, and resellers of e-cigarette products. Of the 471 e-cigarette tweets mentioning a specific place, most mentioned e-cigarette use in class (39.1%, 184/471) followed by home/room/bed (12.5%, 59/471), school (12.1%, 57/471), in public (8.7%, 41/471), the bathroom (5.7%, 27/471), and at work (4.5%, 21/471).&lt;/p>

libraries, using package repositories, and understanding software licenses.
These are such important skills in real world software development, but they
seem to be rarely taught in the classroom. Perhaps a follow-up class could be

Turn those class projects, presentations, and reports into Github repositories or blog posts! I felt vindicated as I read this anecdote in &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Peopleware&lt;/a>:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the spring of 1979, while teaching together in western Canada,we got a call from a computer science professor at the local technical college. He proposed to stop by our hotel after class one evening and buy us beers in exchange for ideas. That&amp;rsquo;s the kind of offer we seldom turn down. What we learned from him that evening was almost certainly worth more than whatever he learned from us.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The teacher was candid about what he needed to be judged a success in his work: He needed his students to get good job offers and lots of them. &amp;ldquo;A Harvard diploma is worth something in and of itself, but our diploma isn&amp;rsquo;t worth squat. If this year&amp;rsquo;s graduates don&amp;rsquo;t get hired fast, there are no students next year and I&amp;rsquo;m out of a job.&amp;rdquo; So he had developed a formula to make his graduates optimally attractive to the job market. Of course he taught them modern techniques for system construction, including structured analysis and design, data-driven design, information hiding, structured coding, walk throughs, and metrics. He also had them work on real applications for nearby companies and agencies. But the center piece of his formula was the portfolio that all students put together to show samples of their work.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>He described how his students had been coached to show off their portfolios as part of each interview:&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>&amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve brought along some samples of the kind of work I do. Here, for instance, is a subroutine in Pascal from one project and a set of COBOL paragraphs from another. As you can see in this portion, we use the loop-with-exit extension advocated by Knuth, but aside from that, it&amp;rsquo;s pure structured code, pretty much the sort of thing that your company standard calls for. And here is the design that this code was written from. The hierarchies and coupling analysis use Myers&amp;rsquo; notation. I designed all of this particular subsystem, and this one little section where we used some Orr methods because the data structure really imposed itself on the process structure. And these are the leveled data flow diagrams that makeup the guts of our specification, and the associated data dictionary. &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In the years since, we&amp;rsquo;ve often heard more about that obscure technical college and those portfolios. We&amp;rsquo;ve met recruiters from as far away as Triangle Park, North Carolina, and Tampa, Florida,who regularly converge upon that distant Canadian campus for a shot at its graduates.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Of course, this was a clever scheme of the professor&amp;rsquo;s to give added allure to his graduates, but what struck us most that evening was the report that interviewers were always surprised by the portfolios. That meant they weren&amp;rsquo;t regularly requiring all candidates to arrive with portfolios. Yet why not? What could be more sensible than asking each candidate to bring along some samples of work to the interview?&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I assumed open-floor plans for software shops were a relatively new invention. However, I just started reading &lt;a class="link" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peopleware:_Productive_Projects_and_Teams" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Peopleware: Productive Projects and Teams&lt;/a>, first published in 1987, and discovered that the first third of the book rails against open floor plan offices. I particularly enjoyed this quote:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>In my years at Bell Labs, we worked in two-person offices. They were spacious, quiet, and the phones could be diverted. I shared my office with Wendl Thomis, who went on to build a small empire as an electric toy maker. In those days, he was working on the Electronic Switching System fault dictionary. The dictionary scheme relied upon the notion of n-space proximity, a concept that was hairy enough to challenge even Wendel&amp;rsquo;s powers of concentration. One afternoon, I was bent over a program listing while Wendl was staring into space, his feet propped up on his desk. Our boss came in and asked, &amp;ldquo;Wendl! What are you doing?&amp;rdquo; Wendl said, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m thinking.&amp;rdquo; And the boss said, &amp;ldquo;Can&amp;rsquo;t you do that at home?&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The difference between that Bell Labs environment and a typical modern-day office plan is that in those quiet offices, one at least had the option of thinking on the job. In most of the office space we encounter today, there is enough noise and interruption to make any serious thinking virtually impossible. More is the shame: Your people bring their brains with them every morning. They could put them to work for you at no additional cost if only there were a small measure of peace and quiet in the workplace.&lt;/p>

anecdotes and impressions. Perhaps ironically (though perhaps not), it is not
a data driven approach to measuring the efficacy of math majors as data
scientists. If you have a differing opinion, I would greatly appreciate you to
carefully articulate it and share it with the world.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently started my third &amp;ldquo;real&amp;rdquo; job since finishing school; at my first and
third jobs I have been a &amp;ldquo;data scientist&amp;rdquo;. I was a math major in college (and
pretty good at it) and spent a year in the math Ph.D. program at the
University of Virginia (and performed well there as well). These two facts
alone would not have equipped me for a career in data science. In fact, it
remains unclear to me that those two facts alone would have prepared me for
any career (with the possible exception of teaching) without significantly
more training.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="there-has-never-been-a-better-time-to-be-a-mathematician">&amp;ldquo;There has never been a better time to be a mathematician&amp;rdquo;?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When I was in college &lt;a class="link" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160315082911/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2006-01-22/math-will-rock-your-world" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Business Week published an article&lt;/a> declaring &amp;ldquo;There has never been a better time to be a mathematician.&amp;rdquo;
At the time, I saw an enormous disconnect between the piece and what I was
being taught in math classes (and thus what I considered to be a
&amp;ldquo;mathematician&amp;rdquo;). I have come across other pieces lauding this as the age of
the mathematicians, and more often than not, I&amp;rsquo;ve wondered if the author knew
what students actually studied in math departments.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="background-on-me">Background on Me
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>The math courses I had as an undergraduate were:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>Linear algebra&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Discrete math&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Differential equations (ODEs and numerical)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Theory of statistics 1&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Numerical analysis 1 (numerical linear algebra) and 2 (quadrature)&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Abstract algebra&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Number theory&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Real analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Complex analysis&lt;/li>
&lt;li>Intermediate analysis (point set topology)&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>My program also required a one semester intro to C++ and two semesters of
freshman physics. In my year as a math Ph.D. student, I took analysis,
algebra, and topology classes; had I stayed in the program, my future
coursework would have been similar: pure math where homework problems
consistent almost exclusively of proofs done with pen and paper (or in LaTeX).&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="what-is-data-science">What is Data Science?
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Though my current position occasionally requires mathematical proof, I suspect
that is rare among data scientist. While the &amp;ldquo;data science&amp;rdquo; demarcation
problem is challenging (and I will not seek to solve it here), it seems
evident that my curriculum lacked preparation in many essential areas of data
science. Chief among these are programming skill, knowledge of experimental
statistics, and experience with math modeling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="data-science-requires-programming-and-engineering">Data Science Requires Programming and Engineering
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Few would argue that programming ability is not a key skill of data science.
As Drew Conway &lt;a class="link" href="http://drewconway.com/zia/2013/3/26/the-data-science-venn-diagram" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>has argued&lt;/a>, a data scientist need not have a degree in computer
science, but &amp;ldquo;Being able to manipulate text files at the command-line,
understanding vectorized operations, thinking algorithmically; these are the
hacking skills that make for a successful data hacker.&amp;rdquo; Many of my undergrad
peers, having briefly seen C++ freshman year and occasionally used Mathematica
to solve ODEs for homework assignments, would have been unaware that
manipulation of a file from the command-line was even possible, much less have
been able to write a simple sed script; there was little difference with my
grad school classmates.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Many data science positions require even more than the ability to solve
problems with code. As &lt;a class="link" href="http://treycausey.com/software_dev_skills.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Trey Causey has recently
explained&lt;/a>, many positions
require understanding of &lt;em>software engineering&lt;/em> skills and tools such as
writing reusable code, using version control, software testing, and logging.
Though I gained a fair bit of programming skill in college, these skills, now
essential in my daily work, remained foreign to me until years later.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="data-science-requires-applied-statistics">Data Science Requires Applied Statistics
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>My math training had a lack of statistics courses. Though my brief exposure to
mathematical statistics has been valuable in picking up machine learning,
experimental statistics was missing altogether. Many data science teams are
interested in questions of causal inference and design and analysis of
experiments; some would make these &lt;em>essential&lt;/em> skills for a data scientist. I
learned nothing about these topics in math departments. Moreover, machine
learning, also a cornerstone of data science, is not a subject I could have
even defined until after I was finished with my math coursework; at the end of
college, I would have said artificial intelligence was mostly about rule-based
systems in Lisp and Prolog.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="data-science-involves-_very-applied-math_">Data Science Involves &lt;em>Very Applied Math&lt;/em>
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>Even if statistics had play a more prominent role in my coursework, those who
have studied statistics know there is often a gulf between understanding
textbook statistics and being able to effectively apply statistical models and
methods to real world problems. This is only an aspect of a bigger issue:
mathematical (including statistical) modeling is an extraordinarily
challenging problem, but instruction on effectively model real world problems
is absent from many math programs. To this day, defining my problem in
mathematical terms one of the hardest problems I face; I am certain that I am
not alone on this. Though I am now armed with a wide variety of mathematical
models, it is rarely clear exactly which model can or should be applied in a
given situation.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I suspect that many people, even technical people, are uncertain as to what
academic math is beyond undergraduate calculus. Mathematicians mostly work in
the logical manipulation of abstractly defined structures. These structures
rarely bear any necessary relationship to physical entities or data sets
outside the abstractly defined domain of discourse. Though some might argue I
am speaking only of &amp;ldquo;pure&amp;rdquo; mathematics, this is often true of what is formally
known as &amp;ldquo;applied mathematics&amp;rdquo;. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.johndcook.com/veryappliedmath.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>John D. Cook has made similar
observations&lt;/a> about the
limitations of pure and applied math (as proper disciplines) in dubbing
himself a &amp;ldquo;very applied mathematician&amp;rdquo;. Very applied mathematics is &amp;ldquo;an
interest in the grubby work required to see the math actually used and a
willingness to carry it out. This involves not just math but also computing,
consulting, managing, marketing, etc.&amp;rdquo; These skills are conspicuously absent
from most math curricula I am familiar with.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="math--data-science">Math → Data Science
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Given this description of how my schooling left me woefully unprepared for a
career in data science, one might ask how I have had two jobs with that title.
I can think of several (though probably not all) reasons.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>First, the academic study of mathematics provides much of the theoretical
underpinnings of data science.&lt;/strong> Mathematics underlies the study of machine
learning, statistics, optimization, data structures, analysis of algorithms,
computer architecture, and other important aspects of data science. Knowledge
of mathematics (potentially) allows the learner to more quickly grasp each of
these fields. For example, learning how &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_analysis" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>principle component
analysis&lt;/a>—a math
model that can be applied and interpreted by someone without formal
mathematical training—works will be significantly easier for someone with
earlier exposure linear algebra. On a meta-level, training in mathematics
forces students to think carefully and solve hard problems; these skills are
valuable in many fields, including data science.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>My second reason is connect to the first: I unwittingly took a number of
courses that later played important roles in my data science toolkit.&lt;/strong> For
example, my current work in Bayesian inference has been made possible by my
knowledge of linear algebra, numerical analysis, stochastic processes, measure
theory, and mathematical statistics.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Third, I did a minor in computer science as an undergraduate.&lt;/strong> That
provided a solid foundation for me when I decided to get serious about
building programming skill in 2010. Though my academic exposure to computer
science lacked any software engineer skills, I left college with a solid grasp
of basic data structures, analysis of algorithms, complexity theory, and a
handful of programming languages.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fourth, I did a masters degree in operations research (after my year as a
math PhD student convinced me pure math wasn&amp;rsquo;t for me).&lt;/strong> This provided me
with experience in math modeling, a broad knowledge of mathematical
optimization (central to machine learning), and the opportunity to take
graduate-level machine learning classes.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Fifth, my insatiable curiosity in computers and problem solving has played a
key role in my career success.&lt;/strong> Eager to learn something about computer
programming, I taught myself PHP and SQL as a high school student (to make
Tolkien fan sites, incidentally). Having been given small Mathematica-based
homework assignments in freshman differential equations, I bought and read a
book on programming Mathematica. Throughout college and grad school, I often
tried—and sometimes succeeded—to write programs to solve homework problems
that professors expected to be solved by hand. This curiosity has proven
valuable time and time again as I&amp;rsquo;ve been required to learn new skills and
solve technical problems of all varieties. I&amp;rsquo;m comfortable jumping in to solve
a new problem at work, because I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing that on my own time for fifteen
years.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Sixth, I have been been fortunate enough to have employers who have
patiently taught me and given me the freedom to learn on my own.&lt;/strong> I have
learned an enormous amount in my two and a half year professional career, and
I don&amp;rsquo;t anticipate slowing down any time soon. As &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/mat_kelcey/status/328179275893207042" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mat
Kelcey&lt;/a> has said:
always be sure you&amp;rsquo;re not the smartest one in the room. I am very thankful for
three jobs where I&amp;rsquo;ve been surrounded by smart people who have taught me a
lot, and for supervisors who trust me enough to let me learn on my own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Finally,&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> it would be hard for me to overvalue the four and a half years of
participation in the data science community on Twitter.&lt;/strong> Through Twitter, I
have the ear of some of data science&amp;rsquo;s brightest minds (most of whom I&amp;rsquo;ve
never met in person), and I&amp;rsquo;ve built a peer network that has helped me find my
current and last job. However, I mostly want to emphasize the pedagogical
value of Twitter. Every day, I&amp;rsquo;m updated on the release of new software tools
for data science, the best new blog posts for our field, and the musings of of
some of my data science heros. Of course, I don&amp;rsquo;t read every blog post or
learn every software tool. But Twitter helps me to recognize which posts are
most worth my time, and because of Twitter, I know &lt;em>something&lt;/em> instead of
&lt;em>nothing&lt;/em> about Theano, Scalding, and dplyr.&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="conclusions">Conclusions
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>I don&amp;rsquo;t know to what extent my experience generalizes&lt;sup id="fnref:4">&lt;a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>, in either the
limitations of my education or my analysis of my success, but I am obviously
not going to let that stop me from drawing some general conclusions.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="hiring-data-scientists">Hiring Data Scientists
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>For those hiring data scientists, recognize that mathematics as taught might
not be the same mathematics you need from your team. Plenty of people with
PhDs in mathematics would be unable to define linear regression or bloom
filters. At the same time, recognize that math majors are taught to think well
and solve hard problems; these skills shouldn&amp;rsquo;t be undervalued. Math majors
are also experienced in reading and learning math! They may be able to read
academic papers and understand difficult (even if new) mathematical more
quickly than a computer scientist or social scientist. Given enough practice
and training, they would probably be excellent programmers.&lt;/p>
&lt;h3 id="studying-math">Studying Math
&lt;/h3>&lt;p>For those studying math, recognize that the field you love, in its formal
sense, may be keeping you away from enjoyable and lucrative careers. Most of
your math professors have spent their adult lives solving math problems on
paper or on a chalkboard. They are inexperienced and, possibly,
unknowledgeable about &lt;em>very applied mathematics&lt;/em>. A successful career in pure
mathematics will be very hard and will require you to be very good. While
there seem to be lots of jobs in teaching, they will rarely pay well.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;re still an student, you have a great opportunity to take control of
your career path. Consider taking computer science classes (e.g. data
structures, algorithms, software engineering, machine learning) and statistics
classes (e.g. experimental design, data analysis, data mining).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>For both students and graduates, recognize your math knowledge becomes very
marketable when combined skills such as programming and machine learning;
there are a wealth of good books, MOOCs, and blog posts that can help you
learn these things. More over, the barrier to entry for getting started with
production quality tools has never been lower. Don&amp;rsquo;t let your coursework be
the extent of your education. There is so much more to learn!&lt;sup id="fnref:5">&lt;a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>

&lt;li id="fn:1">
&lt;p>At the same time, my academic training in operations research failed me, in some aspects, for a successful career in operations research. For example, practical math modeling was not sufficiently emphasized and the skills of computer programming and software development were undervalued.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;/li>
&lt;li id="fn:2">
&lt;p>Of course, I have plenty of data science skills left to learn. My knowledge of experimental design is still pretty fuzzy. I still struggle with effective mathematical modeling. I haven&amp;rsquo;t deployed a large scale machine learning system to production. I suck at software logging. I have no idea how deep learning works.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:2" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Among other reasons, I didn&amp;rsquo;t really plan to get where I am today.

>pyspark documentation&lt;/a> doesn&amp;rsquo;t include an example for the aggregateByKey RDD method. I didn&amp;rsquo;t find any nice examples online, so I wrote my own.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s what the documentation does say:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;code>aggregateByKey(self, zeroValue, seqFunc, combFunc, numPartitions=None)&lt;/code>&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Aggregate the values of each key, using given combine functions and a neutral &amp;ldquo;zero value&amp;rdquo;. This function can return a different result type, U, than the type of the values in this RDD, V. Thus, we need one operation for merging a V into a U and one operation for merging two U&amp;rsquo;s, The former operation is used for merging values within a partition, and the latter is used for merging values between partitions. To avoid memory allocation, both of these functions are allowed to modify and return their first argument instead of creating a new U.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>&lt;code>reduceByKey&lt;/code> and &lt;code>aggregateByKey&lt;/code> are much more efficient than &lt;code>groupByKey&lt;/code> and should be used for aggregations as much as possible.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In the example below, I create an RDD that is a short list of characters. My functions will aggregate the functions together with concatenation. I added brackets to the two types of concatenation to help give you an idea of what &lt;code>aggregateByKey&lt;/code> is doing.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One IFTTT rule I have appends my weight to a text file in Dropbox. This file looks like this:&lt;/p>

&lt;/div>&lt;p>For a few months, I have been experimenting with using this time series to give myself a less-noisy update on my weight, and I&amp;rsquo;ve come up with a decent solution.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.r-project.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>R script&lt;/a> will take my weight time series, resample it, smooth it with a rolling median over the last month, and write summary stats to a text file in my Dropbox. It&amp;rsquo;s not the prettiest script, but it gets the job done for now.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>The output looks something like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1

&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>I want this script to be run every time my weight is updated, so I created a second IFTTT rule that will create a new file in my Dropbox, called &lt;em>new_weight_measurement&lt;/em>, every time I weigh in. On my Mac Mini, I have a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.noodlesoft.com/hazel.php" title="Noodlesoft | Hazel"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Hazel&lt;/a> rule to watch for a file of this name to be created. When Hazel sees the file, it runs my R script and deletes that file.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>My Hazel rule looks like this:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2014/08/hazel-weight-1.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The &amp;rsquo;embedded script&amp;rsquo; that is run is the R script above; I just have to tell Hazel to use the &lt;code>Rscript&lt;/code> shell.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2014/08/r-script-from-hazel.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>At this point, every time I step on my scale, a text file with readable statistics about my smoothed weight appear in my Dropbox folder.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, I want this updated information to be pushed directly too me. Hazel is again the perfect tool for the job. I have a second Hazel rule that watches for &lt;em>Weight Stats.txt&lt;/em> to be created. Hazel can pass the path of the updated file into any script of your choice. You could, for example, use &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.mailgun.com/" title="Transactional Email API Service for Developers - Mailgun"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mailgun&lt;/a> to email it to yourself or &lt;a class="link" href="https://pushover.net/" title="Pushover: Simple Notifications for Android, iOS, and Desktop"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Pushover&lt;/a> to push it to your mobile devices. Obviously, I want to tweet mine.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have a Twitter account called &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/hopsfitness" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>@hopsfitness&lt;/a> where I&amp;rsquo;ve recently been tracking my fitness progress. On my Mac Mini, I have &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/sferik/t" title="t GitHub"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>t&lt;/a> configured to access @hopsfitness from the command line. Thus, tweeting my updated statistics is just a matter of a little shell script executed by Hazel:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2014/08/hazel-weight-2.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Since this data goes to Twitter, I can get it painlessly pushed to my phone: Twitter still allows you subscribe to accounts via text message, which I&amp;rsquo;ve done with @hopsfitness. A minute or so after I step on my scale, I get a text with useful information about where I am and where I&amp;rsquo;m going; this is much preferable to the noisy weight I see on my scale.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;strong>Update&lt;/strong> (2014-12-06): I replaced my R script with a Python/pandas script. It requires Python 3 (to render the delta characters).&lt;/p>

target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>IPython Notebooks&lt;/a> for work. One of the few annoyances of IPython Notebooks is that they require keeping a terminal window open to run the notebook server and kernel. I routinely launch a Notebook kernel in a directory where I keep my work related notebooks. Earlier this week, I started to wonder if there was a way for me to keep this kernel running all the time &lt;em>without&lt;/em> having to keep a terminal window open..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>If you&amp;rsquo;ve ever tried to do chron-like automation on OS X, you&amp;rsquo;ve surely come across &lt;a class="link" href="http://launchd.info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>launchd&lt;/a>, &amp;ldquo;a unified, open-source service management framework for starting, stopping and managing daemons, applications, processes, and script&amp;rdquo;. You&amp;rsquo;ve probably also gotten frustated with launchd and given up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I recently started using &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.soma-zone.com/LaunchControl/" title="soma-zone: LaunchControl"
target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>LaunchControl&lt;/a> &amp;ldquo;a fully-featured launchd GUI&amp;rdquo; for launchd; it&amp;rsquo;s pretty nice and worth $10. It occurred to me that LaunchControl would be a good way to keep my Notebook kernel running in the background.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I created a LaunchControl to run the following command.&lt;/p>
&lt;div class="highlight">&lt;div class="chroma">
&lt;table class="lntable">&lt;tr>&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code>&lt;span class="lnt">1
&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>
&lt;td class="lntd">
&lt;pre tabindex="0" class="chroma">&lt;code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback">&lt;span class="line">&lt;span class="cl">/usr/local/bin/IPython notebook --matplotlib inline --port=9777 --browser=false
&lt;/span>&lt;/span>&lt;/code>&lt;/pre>&lt;/td>&lt;/tr>&lt;/table>
&lt;/div>
&lt;/div>&lt;p>This launches an IPython Notebook kernel accessible on port 9777; setting the browser flag to something other than an installed browser prevents a browser window from opening when the kernel is launch.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I added three other launchd keys in LaunchControl:&lt;/p>
&lt;ul>
&lt;li>A &lt;em>Working Directory&lt;/em> key to tell LaunchControl to start my notebook in my desired folder.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>A &lt;em>Run At Load&lt;/em> key to tell it to start my kernel as soon as I load the job.&lt;/li>
&lt;li>And a &lt;em>Keep alive&lt;/em> key to tell LaunchControl to restart my kernel should the process ever die.&lt;/li>
&lt;/ul>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s how it looks in LaunchControl:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2014/08/launchcontrol.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>After I created it, I just had to save and load, and I was off to the races; the IPython kernel starts and runs in the background. I can access my Notebooks by navigating to 127.0.0.1:9777 in my browser. Actually, I added &lt;code>127.0.0.1 parsely.scratch&lt;/code> to my hosts file so I can access my Notebooks at parsely.scratch:9777. This works nicely with Chrome&amp;rsquo;s autocomplete feature. I&amp;rsquo;m avoiding the temptation to run nginx and give it an even prettier url.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Links for August 28, 2014</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/sundry-links-for-august-28-2014/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Aug 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/sundry-links-for-august-28-2014/</guid><description>&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2161406/how-do-i-generate-a-uniform-random-integer-partition" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Now that I&amp;rsquo;m four months further down the line, I thought I&amp;rsquo;d post a follow-up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I continue to be fascinated with how noisy my weight time series is. While I&amp;rsquo;ve continued to lose weight over time, my weight goes up two out of five mornings.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Here&amp;rsquo;s a plot of the time series of my change in weight. Note how often the change is positive, i.e. I appear to have gained weight:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2013/11/weight_change1.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>This volatility can hide the fact that I&amp;rsquo;m making progress! When I put a regression line through the points, you can see that the average change slightly below zero:&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2013/11/weight_change2.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I have wondered recently if my average change in weight is correlated with the day of the week. My hypothesis is that my weight tends to go up over the weekends, so I created a boxplot of my change in weight categorized by day.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2013/11/weight_box.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Indeed, on Sundays and Mondays (i.e. weight change from Saturday morning to Sunday morning and Sunday morning to Monday morning) my median weight change is slightly above zero. This makes sense to me: on Saturdays, I&amp;rsquo;m more likely to be doing things with friends, and thus I have less control over my meals.&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I wish I had a good explanation for why the change on Friday is so dramatic, but I don&amp;rsquo;t. Any guesses?&lt;/p>

>@&lt;em>primes&lt;/em>&lt;/a>. Every hour, they tweet the subsequent prime number. This made me wonder two things. First, what is the largest prime that you can tweet (in base-10 encoding in 140 characters).&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> Second, how long until they get there.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Doing some quick calculations in Mathematica, I believe the largest 140 digit prime is the following:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999&lt;/br>
9999999999999999999999999999999999999999999999&lt;/br>

&lt;p>As for how long it would take, recall that the number of primes less than $n$ &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prime_number_theorem" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>is approximately&lt;/a> $\frac{n}{\ln n}$. The number of primes less than $10^{141}$ is approximately&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$\pi(10^{140}) = \frac{10^{140}}{140\cdot \ln 10} = 3.1\cdot 10^{137}.$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>That&amp;rsquo;s $3\cdot 10^{57}$ times the estimated number of atoms in the universe. Looks like &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/_primes_" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve heard this sort of thing repeatedly from tall men.

Were anyone to say something original or witty or different in any way, the constant chatter thrown their way might at least be entertaining.

&lt;p>In May, I bought a &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Withings-Wireless-Scale-WS-30-Black/dp/B00AXYL4M6/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1374864050&amp;amp;sr=8-4&amp;amp;keywords=withings" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Withings WS-30&lt;/a> wireless scale.
When I first heard about this wifi scales, I thought they sounded like a gimmick, however the Withings has become a helpful tool in the weight loss process.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Every morning, I step on the scale and my weight is automatically broadcast to MyFitnessPal, &lt;a class="link" href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/monitor-your-weight/id413313086?mt=8" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Monitor Your Weight&lt;/a> on iOS, and a text file in my Dropbox folder (via &lt;a class="link" href="https://ifttt.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>IFTTT&lt;/a> and Withings&amp;rsquo; API).
MyFitnessPal adjusts my daily calorie limit by my weight, Monitor Your Weight is a great tool for visualizing progressing, and I use the text file to import a ggplot time series of my weight into &lt;a class="link" href="https://dayoneapp.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Day One&lt;/a> each month.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>An interesting aspect of my weight time series is how noisy it is. (No doubt this is true for others as well.)
On many mornings, my weight is up from the day before (despite a fairly consistent net caloric deficit).
As you can see from the plot, my weight jumps up and down daily even though the overall trend is downward.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2013/07/weightseries.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I have been wondering what percentage of days I actually lose weight, so I decided to find out.
The plot below is a histogram of my weight change from day to day.&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2013/07/weighthist.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The data appears nearly Gaussian around 0! (In fact, the p-value on the Shapiro-Wilk normality test is 0.11, arguably not small enough to reject the null hypothesis that the data are &lt;em>not&lt;/em> normally distributed.) Fortunately the mean of the differences is actually about -0.24 (pounds/day), and my progress is downward.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In total, I lost weight on 48 days, gained on 33, and stayed the same on 4% of the days.
That means I&amp;rsquo;ve steadly lost weight while only moving down on 56% of days.
I guess I don&amp;rsquo;t need to be depressed every time my weight jumps up slightly&amp;hellip;.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>This isn&amp;rsquo;t 100% true. I&amp;rsquo;m hiding the fact that I missed weighing-in on some days.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

>Monte Carlo methods&lt;/a> of various kinds keep coming up in my work. Despite significant application of Monte Carlo in my grad school research, I think I only know enough to be dangerous. I&amp;rsquo;d like to get a better grasp on Monte Carlo methods (especially MCMC and simulation).&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/359642533950787585" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>asked on Twitter&lt;/a> if anyone had a recommended reference that was readable and practical. Despite my love of measure theory, what I want is &lt;em>Monte Carlo Methods for the &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.johndcook.com/veryappliedmath.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Very Applied Mathematician&lt;/a>&lt;/em>, not a theoretical text.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I got several recommendations. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure that any are exactly what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for, but I am certainly going to look deeper into them. Interestingly, they are all Springer books.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Several people recommended Glasserman&amp;rsquo;s &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Financial-Engineering-Stochastic-Modelling-Probability/dp/0387004513" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Monte Carlo Methods in Financial Engineering&lt;/a>. I don&amp;rsquo;t work in the financial sector, so it&amp;rsquo;s hard for me to evaluate the table of contents to tell how well it generalizes.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Someone else recommended both &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.com/dp/038787836X" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Explorations in Monte Carlo Methods&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Chapman-Handbooks-Statistical-Methods/dp/1420079417" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Handbook of Markov Chain Monte Carlo&lt;/a> for two levels of MCMC.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finally, I got a recommendation for &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.amazon.com/Introducing-Monte-Carlo-Methods-ebook/dp/B00440E0JO/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;amp;ie=UTF8&amp;amp;qid=1374616614&amp;amp;sr=1-1&amp;amp;keywords=introducing&amp;#43;monte&amp;#43;carlo&amp;#43;methods&amp;#43;with&amp;#43;R" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Introducing Monte Carlo Methods with R&lt;/a>. This might be closest to what I&amp;rsquo;m looking for.

When I realized that I loved my CS theory courses while my classmates hated them, I decide to major in math instead. I enjoyed the programming classes enough, but programming is not what I wanted to spend my time doing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The summer after my junior year, I was accepted to a &lt;em>math&lt;/em> REU at Rochester Institute of Technology. The first thing my adviser &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/~spr/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Stanislaw Radziszowski&lt;/a> asked me was whether or not I could program! I spent the whole summer programming combinatorial graph theory-related algorithms in C&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Now I, like many of my operations research classmates, spend much of my time programming. Despite the importance of writing code for solving operations research problems, I am surprised how little programming is discussed. The &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.or.ncsu.edu/admission/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>admissions page for my program&lt;/a> says nothing about programming ability, but it is implicitly assumed that programming is a skill that students have.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Moreover, I suspect the operations research-specific parts of the research behind many journal articles is only a fraction of the actual work done by the authors. Much of the required work is implementation and debugging of their algorithms. Yet, articles contain little-to-no discussion of the actual code. Even worse, the code is often not published or reviewed. I can only imagine how many coding errors underly the results of peer-reviewed papers.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://kuomarc.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/top-hackers-we-need-you-for-operations-research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Marc Kuo recently blogged&lt;/a> about how operations researchers need to get with the program (pun intended). His post kicked of tons of discussion in its &lt;a class="link" href="https://kuomarc.wordpress.com/2012/07/02/top-hackers-we-need-you-for-operations-research/#comments" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>comments&lt;/a>, on &lt;a class="link" href="https://plus.google.com/110464871801965858778/posts/QDtHN7PcsCL" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>Hacker News&lt;/a>, and on &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.or-exchange.com/questions/5783/which-programming-skillsexperience-are-essential-for-being-a-good-or-researcher-if-any?utm_medium=twitter&amp;amp;utm_source=twitterfeed" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>OR-Exchange&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This discussion came at a good time for me. I&amp;rsquo;m in the middle of my first big coding project of my PhD research. Despite completing a computer science minor and spending two summers doing nothing but coding, I never learned good software engineering practices. I decided at the beginning of the summer to force myself not to just write this code to get the job done but to write &lt;em>good&lt;/em> code.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To start, I finally started using &lt;a class="link" href="http://git-scm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>git&lt;/a> and &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>github&lt;/a> for version control. I have tried several times before, but I have always found it rather confusing&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.vogella.com/articles/Git/article.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>This git tutorial&lt;/a> finally got me over the hump. Now I can easily branch my code into different versions, and I have the ability to go back to old versions when I screw something up.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Second, I started teaching myself about &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unit_testing" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>unit testing&lt;/a>. Code testing was never mentioned in any of my classes in college, and I never hear operations researchers talk about it. Again, I have no doubt that the code behind much published work is full of mistakes. Operations researchers need good testing practices?&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Third, I&amp;rsquo;m trying to write clean, object-oriented, well-commented code. My intention is to publish this code on &lt;a class="link" href="https://github.com/tdhopper" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>github&lt;/a> when the corresponding paper is published. I want my results to be easily reproducible by others and open to scrutiny. I would also like my code to be reusable for future research. My design patterns might not be quite there yet, but I&amp;rsquo;m trying to move in that direction.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I realized that I&amp;rsquo;ve used the word &lt;em>I&lt;/em> as much as Stephen Wolfram blog post. I have no desire to toot my own horn here; I&amp;rsquo;m just thankful this conversation is happening, and I want to continue it. Good software is crucial to good operations research (both in the academy and out), and yet academic operations researchers, in my experience, talk very little about good software engineering practices. We can do better.&lt;/p>

I got some great answers! And the students seem to enjoy it. My favorite limerick (on improper integrals):&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>An integral has bounds from zero to one&lt;br />
You finish the problem and think you are done&lt;br />
Then your mind double checks&lt;br />
The equation is one over x&lt;br >
And the improper integral has a different sum&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>My favorite haiku gives the formula for integration by parts:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Int of mu dv:&lt;br />
Equal to mu v minus&lt;br />
Int of v d mu&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Here are some other good ones:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Doing Integrals… &lt;br />
Oh How I shall miss thee, &lt;br />
Calc! Goodbye, It&amp;rsquo;s been real?&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calculus is hard &lt;br />
Derivative and limit &lt;br />
¡Yo no se hombre!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>MacLaurin Series &lt;br />
is an infinite series &lt;br />
Centered at zero&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Calculus is great&lt;br />
I&amp;rsquo;m sure I&amp;rsquo;ll use this in life&lt;br />
Or maybe I won&amp;rsquo;t&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Studying &amp;rsquo;til 5&lt;br />
And almost sleeping thru test&lt;br />
Was a real bad call&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Finding integrals&lt;br />

I&amp;rsquo;ve known many students who flew through calc I in college (having taken calculus in high school) only to receive a reality check from calc II the next semester. In the US, calc II often involves a significant section on &amp;ldquo;techniques of integration&amp;rdquo; where students learn techniques such as partial fractions, trig substitutions, integration by parts. Unlike much of differential calculus, which is taught in calc I, and unlike much of the math taught before college, integration is harder to do algorithmically. That is, a calc II professor cannot simply outline surefire steps guaranteed to give an antiderivative for any function. The inimitable Robert Ghrist explains it this way in his &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.math.upenn.edu/~ghrist/FLCT/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>funny little calculus text&lt;/a>&amp;rdquo;:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-10-at-5.09.27-PM.png" >&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/01/Screen-Shot-2012-01-10-at-5.09.27-PM.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Of course, algorithms for computing many antiderivatives do exist (and are used in Maple, Mathematica, and Wolfram Alpha), but I&amp;rsquo;d be fired if I tried to take my undergrads through &lt;em>Symbolic Integration I: Transcendental Functions&lt;/em>..&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Instead, calculus II teachers teach a handful of methods and attempt to teach students intuition for where to use what technique. Even more important, I try to teach my students the skill of trying a method, seeing that the method does not work, then trying something else. Try-fail-try-fail-try again. I do not think that high school students learn that skill—a skill vital to success not just in calc II, but in every discipline requiring analytical problem solving. Yesterday, my adviser and I were discussing the first big research problem that I&amp;rsquo;ll be tackling this summer. He noted that our first attempt at solving a massive problem would probably fail; they usually do.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Fortunately, I&amp;rsquo;ve been failing at solving problems at least since taking number theory with &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.concord.edu/fs/dkrider" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Dan Krider&lt;/a> in 2003. I know what Edison meant by, &amp;ldquo;I have not failed. I&amp;rsquo;ve just found 10,000 ways that won&amp;rsquo;t work.&amp;rdquo; I hope my students are learning how to fail and how to try again. However, I think that kids need to learn earlier. High school assignments should not be set up for students to succeed the first time, every time. Somehow, teachers need to allow students to take risks, learn from their mistakes, and rebound. I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear feedback from students who are learning these lessons and teachers trying to teach them.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Average Area of a Random Hull</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/average-area-of-a-random-hull/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/average-area-of-a-random-hull/</guid><description>&lt;p>Yesterday, someone on MathOverflow asked&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>Consider $n$ points generated randomly and uniformly on a unit square. What is the expected value of the area (as a function of $n$) enclosed by the convex hull of the set of points?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Someone quickly cited &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.math.kth.se/~johanph/area12.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>2004 paper&lt;/a> provides an analytical result for the cases where $n=3$ and $n=4$:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>For $n=3$ the expected value is $11/144$ and for $n=4$ it is $11/72$.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>This is certainly a nontrivial result. However, the value can be approximated by generating a large number of random points, finding the area of the convex hull, and averaging the areas. Of course, finding the convex hull and the area of the convex hull of a set of points requires a little work. Mathematica provides functions for generating random points and finding the area of the convex hull of a set of points quickly. As a result, I was able to perform a Monte Carlo simulation for the $n=3$ and $n=4$ case in a couple of lines of Mathematica code:&lt;/p>

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Sampling 5000 cases for each returned results fairly close to the predicted average.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>My Email Analytics</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/my-email-analytics/</link><pubDate>Thu, 05 Apr 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/my-email-analytics/</guid><description>&lt;p>Last month, Stephen Wolfram did a blog post on the &lt;a class="link" href="http://blog.stephenwolfram.com/2012/03/the-personal-analytics-of-my-life/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Personal Analytics&lt;/a> of his life. For years, he&amp;rsquo;s recorded every phone call, keyboard stroke, email, and step. He made beautiful graphs to show his activity over the years. A Wolfram Alpha developer just posted a &lt;a class="link" href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2012/04/05/analyzing-your-email-with-mathematica/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Mathematica notebook&lt;/a> on the Wolfram blog allowing anyone to do the same email analysis that Wolfram did with any IMAP email account. Of course, I dropped what I was doing to try it out with my Gmail account. At first, it failed to finish processing my incoming email because the JVM ran out of memory. It took me a while to figure out how to tell JLink to let Java have more memory&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. Here&amp;rsquo;s a plot of emails sent by from Gmail me over the last six years:&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/04/blog-post-email-code.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>I started using Gmail regularly after I graduated from college in 2008 (once my college Exchange-based email account was gone). My emailing was noticeably sparse from May 2008-May 2009. During that time I was a teacher, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t spend nearly as much time on a computer as I do now. You can also see a gap during the summer of 2011. I was working at Kiva Systems at the time and primarily used my company email. On the horizontal axis, you notice I&amp;rsquo;m pretty silent between 11 PM and 7 AM. I need my sleep, and I never work at night! My emailing is light from 6-9 PM too. Here&amp;rsquo;s a graph of my email received over the past six years. It comes in pretty heavy from 8 AM to midnight!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/04/blog-post-email-code1.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>The thick line just under 6 AM is the Google Calendar email updates I used to get every morning. I stopped getting those once I got an iPod Touch this past Christmas. I can&amp;rsquo;t remember what email used to come at 3 AM for a few years. This next graphic shows the average number of emails I receive per day for each month. My amount of emailing ramped up once I started using email. Notice the downward trend on incoming emails recently: I&amp;rsquo;ve been unsubscribing from unnecessary mailing lists and circulars. My emailing had pretty serious peak last May right before I moved to Boston. Not sure why.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/04/Screen-Shot-2012-04-05-at-2.17.28-PM.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>Here we have a histogram of the time at which I send emails. Apparently I&amp;rsquo;m most likely to send an email just after 10 PM. I wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have guess that. Don&amp;rsquo;t expect to hear from me after midnight!&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/04/blog-post-email-code3.png">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>As a good operations researcher, I wondered if I received email according to a &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poisson_process" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Poisson process&lt;/a>. I pulled the email time stamp data into R. I get email pretty steadily between 8 AM and 10 PM. I looked at the emails that arrived in that interval since September 2011. The mean interarrival time is 0.53 hours. The standard deviation is 0.92. If it were a poisson process, interarrival times would be exponentially distributed, and the mean and standard deviation would be equal. Below is a histogram of the interarrival times of my emails. The red line is an exponential distribution with the rate set to 1 over the mean interarrival time of my emails. It&amp;rsquo;s not a terrible fit!&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> One reason the email arrival rate might not be exponential is that I frequently have back-and-forth email conversations with people, which skews the distribution towards short interarrival times. I might do some more statistics later, but I have homework to do.&lt;/p>

One thing I&amp;rsquo;ve noticed is that most of the math in machine learning is optimization. Regression is typically minimization of some error term. Support vector machines are a quadratic optimization problem with linear constraints. Learning a neural network is &lt;em>simply&lt;/em> solving a nonconvex optimization problem. Clustering often takes the form of expectation-maximization. I&amp;rsquo;m currently learning Bayesian network structure learning which is an extremely difficult combinatorial optimization problem.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Yesterday on Twitter, I commented that I am surprised at how little operations research people and machine learning people talk. Most of the math of OR is, like machine learning, optimization. All the same &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karush%E2%80%93Kuhn%E2%80%93Tucker_conditions" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>algorithms&lt;/a>; we just apply them in different ways. I got helpful feedback from the nerds that follow me. &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/#!/jefflinderoth" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Jeff Linderoth&lt;/a> pointed to the recent book &lt;a class="link" href="http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;amp;tid=12674" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Optimization for Machine Learning&lt;/a> by his colleague (et al) Stephen J. Wright at University of Wisconsin, Madison. From what I can tell, Wright is an OR guy in a computer scientists clothing. There&amp;rsquo;s a &lt;a class="link" href="http://videolectures.net/nips2010_wright_oaml/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>two-hour lecture&lt;/a> by Wright on the same topic that I look forward to watching. Jeff also pointed to the work of his colleague &lt;a class="link" href="http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~brecht/publications.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Ben Recht&lt;/a> who&amp;rsquo;s looking at the optimization problems in ML from a theoretical standpoint. &lt;/p>

>Jorge Nocedal&lt;/a>&amp;rsquo;s work at Northwestern. Nocedal and Recht seem to have feet in both worlds. &lt;a class="link" href="https://twitter.com/johnmyleswhite" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>John Myles White&lt;/a> noted that the legendary optimizer Stephen Boyd came to the New York Academy of Science&amp;rsquo;s Machine Learning event last year. I also came across a 2006 paper on &lt;a class="link" href="http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/papers/volume7/MLOPT-intro06a/MLOPT-intro06a.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>The Interplay of Optimization and Machine Learning Research&lt;/a>. The authors note some difference between an OR and ML perspective on optimization:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>We observe that the qualities of good optimization algorithms from the machine learning and optimization perspectives can be quite different. Mathematical programming puts a premium on accuracy, speed, and robustness. Since generalization is the bottom line in machine learning and training is normally done off-line, accuracy and small speed improvements are of little concern in machine learning. Machine learning prefers simpler algorithms that work in reasonable computational time for specific classes of problems&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>A bigger question might be where optimization lies as a discipline. Since I&amp;rsquo;ve been in OR, I&amp;rsquo;ve always considered optimization as a subfield of OR. But as I read applied OR literature, I find it jarring to see the details of &lt;em>solving&lt;/em> a difficult optimization problem mixed with the application of the solution to a real world problem. Of course, both ML and OR require practitioners to understand how the algorithms work. Optimization problems are hard, and a black box solution rarely works for any of us. But perhaps optimization will become a field of its own that OR and ML can both feed from instead of the two working independently.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>I haven&amp;rsquo;t read the whole paper (that&amp;rsquo;s from the abstract), but I&amp;rsquo;m not entirely convinced that is true. Modern machine learning often requires large scale problems to be solved quickly on-line, while optimizers often solve a problem  offline and speed is negotiable.&amp;#160;&lt;a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&amp;#x21a9;&amp;#xfe0e;&lt;/a>&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One questioner asked about open sourcing old versions of Mathematica. &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xz8by" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

&lt;p>His most interesting answer is &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.reddit.com/r/IAmA/comments/qisot/im_stephen_wolfram_mathematica_nks_wolframalpha/c3xxhvt" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>his opinion on Matlab&lt;/a>. He argues that Matlab has remained matrix-centric when so much of contemporary mathematics goes beyond that. &amp;ldquo;In the complete web of algorithms in Mathematica, things that can reasonably be represented as numerical matrices are perhaps 5 or 10% of the total.&amp;rdquo; However, Wolfram believes that Mathematica isn&amp;rsquo;t outdone by Maple in the realm of matrices.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Wolfram relays that a major goal of Mathematica is &amp;ldquo;to make a single coherent system in which one can work, and in which everything fits nicely together.&amp;rdquo; &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.tdhopper.com/blog/mathematica-a-love-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

Two years ago, I stumbled across Peter Norvig&amp;rsquo;s essay &lt;a class="link" href="http://norvig.com/spell-correct.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>How to Write a Spelling Corrector&lt;/a>. Google is a notoriously good spelling corrector; just try googling &amp;ldquo;&lt;a class="link" href="http://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;amp;q=spellign&amp;amp;pbx=1&amp;amp;oq=spellign&amp;amp;aq=f&amp;amp;aqi=g-s4&amp;amp;aql=&amp;amp;gs_sm=3&amp;amp;gs_upl=355l2969l0l3671l8l8l0l0l0l0l152l775l4.4l8l0&amp;amp;gs_l=hp.3..0i10l4.355l2969l0l3672l8l8l0l0l0l0l152l775l4j4l8l0&amp;amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.,cf.osb&amp;amp;fp=6274c5cd76393bc1&amp;amp;biw=1257&amp;amp;bih=802" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>An Introduction to Programming with Mathematica&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Seven years later, I find myself using Mathematica almost daily. As a student, it is one of the most helpful tools at my disposal, and it has saved me countless hours of tedious computation by hand. I’m not sure I can express all the ways in which I appreciate it, but I hope to share some.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I admit that I primarily use Mathematica as a glorified calculator. Most of my code is single use code to help me with a homework assignment. I have written some longer code for class projects, but rarely more than a few hundred lines. However, for the work that I have had over the past seven years, it is exactly the right tool, and I don’t know of any other language which comprehensively offers all the features I need within its core language.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>One other note to the Redditors and cynics (but I repeat myself): I&amp;rsquo;m not recommending or encouraging programmers to jump ship from their main languages to Mathematica. I’m not suggesting that Mathematica doesn’t have any shortcomings. I’m not arguing that Mathematica is good for everything. I’m well aware that Mathematica is an expensive, closed platform. I’m well aware that Mathematic has the worst undo ever. I’m not writing an advertisement or getting paid by Wolfram. I’m simply shared the story of a program that has become an invaluable part of my schooling.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="1-powerful-symbolic-computations">1. Powerful Symbolic Computations
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Perhaps the thing Mathematica is most well-known for is symbolic computations. The oldest Mathematica file I have on my computer is a single line of code that I apparently used on a differential equations quiz in 2005. In it, I did a partial fraction decomposition: the bane of calculus 2 students, but easy for a computer.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>One of the benefits of Mathematica, is the elegance of typesetting in both the input and the output. Wolfram has taken great care to make Mathematica an aesthetically excellent experience, and I’m grateful for that.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>These days, I avoid doing algebraic manipulations by hand at all costs. It’s not worth it to me to risk making errors that might trickle down into my work. I let computers handle such things for me. Thus, when I’m doing homework, I usually have a notebook open filled with one-off expressions like&lt;/p>

&lt;p>Of course, it can solve much harder problems too. Integration is no problem. Here’s a triple integral I solved in my electricity and magnetism class sophomore year. (I wish I remembered what it all means.)&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The output is messy because Mathematica tried to solve the integral as generally as possible. We can get a more clear answer by clarifying some assumptions we’re making about the parameters.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>However, again like R, Mathematica is really built for functional programming. &lt;a class="link" href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/FunctionalOperationsOverview.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>Wolfram has a great tutorial on the topic, but let me share a brief example from my own use. &lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>On a homework assignment this week, I wanted to measure the total tardiness for various schedules in a single machine problem. Each of the four jobs had a total processing time, given by {2,4,6,8}, and a due date {4,14,10,16}. The tardiness of a job for a given schedule (i.e. ordering of the jobs) is 0 if the job is completed on time and how late it is otherwise. First I set processing time and due dates for the four jobs:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/02/alovestory_12.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="alovestory_12.gif"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Any permutation of the job indices {1,2,3,4} gives a valid schedule. Suppose we want to know the total lateness of the schedule x={1,4,3,2}. The ordering of processing times is given by p[[x]] so the time when each job is completed is a running total of the processing times:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/02/alovestory_13.gif"

loading="lazy"
alt="alovestory_14.gif"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>The lateness of each job is defined by the completion time minus the due date:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/02/alovestory_15.gif"

loading="lazy"
alt="alovestory_16.gif"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>To get the tardiness, we want the max of the lateness and zero. There are a number of ways to do this, but one is to apply a max function to each element of the list:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/02/alovestory_17.gif"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>(The &lt;em>#&lt;/em> and &lt;em>&amp;amp;&lt;/em> are part of Mathematica’s notation for &lt;a class="link" href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/PureFunctions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>pure functions&lt;/a>.) Or, more succinctly,&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/02/alovestory_19.gif"

loading="lazy"
alt="alovestory_20.gif"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In a non-functional language, this would have required a for-loop and several lines of code. In a functional language, it naturally fits into a single line. Getting the total tardiness adds no more complexity:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/02/alovestory_21.gif"

>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>since % returns the last line evaluated.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>This is only a simple example of a functional operation in Mathematica. Expressions can become much more complex. All my Mathematica code is littered with functional expressions, but rarely will you see a for-loop or a while-loop in my code. And I like it that way.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Oh, and if you want to parallelize these operations: &lt;a class="link" href="https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/ParallelComputing.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>not a problem&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="3-optimization">3. Optimization
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>As a student of operations research, I spend a lot of time solving optimization problems. Solving optimization problems of many flavors is built right into Mathematica. Solving linear programs given the matrices is easy with the LinearProgramming function. Because most of the problems I’ve solved up to this point have been “toy” problems for class, I can’t attest to Mathematica’s ability to handle large-scale problems, but they &lt;a class="link" href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/ConstrainedOptimizationLinearProgramming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>claim&lt;/a> to be able to handle large problems. Mathematica’s ExampleData function gives easy access to many data sets, including &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.netlib.org/lp/data/readme" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>NetLib.org&lt;/a>’s LP problems. Mathematica could solve this problem with 6072 rows and 12230 columns in 60 seconds on my 11-inch Macbook Air.&lt;/p>

&lt;p>The built-in solver certainly isn’t as robust as CPLEX or other commercial solver, but it does, at least, provide &lt;a class="link" href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/ConstrainedOptimizationLinearProgramming.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>several solution methods&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I most often find myself using the Minimize and Maximize functions with explicit constraints:&lt;/p>

&lt;p>In the future, I hope to do a post on using Mathematica as a pseudo-modeling language. You can see the &lt;a class="link" href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/Optimization.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>documentation&lt;/a> for a number of other optimization related functions.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Recently, I’ve been working with stochastic dynamic programming problems (i.e. Markov decision processes). Mathematica offers &lt;a class="link" href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/FunctionsThatRememberValuesTheyHaveFound.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>the easiest memoization I’ve ever seen in any language&lt;/a>. Combined with functional aspects, I can solve dynamic programs with relatively little code.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="4-graphics">4. Graphics
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>When I am doing school work, I want to be able to do complicated computations and then visualize the results quickly. Because of how tightly knit the native Mathematica graphics are built into the core language, I don’t have to go out of my way to do this.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Last semester, I wanted to demonstrate a Monte Carlo algorithm for navigating a maze. Over 200 iterations, a relatively simple solver (built, of course, in Mathematica) could find an optimal path through a 4 by 3 maze. for a report I was writing.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Working straight from the output of the solver, in about twenty lines of code, I output a grid showing candidate solution every other iteration (the green cells indicate cells where the action is optimal). Followed by an Export function, the graphic was ready to be included in my &lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/02/alovestory_27.gif"
loading="lazy"
alt="alovestory_27.gif"

&lt;/figure>
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="5-documentation">5. Documentation
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Wolfram has been careful to write readable and thorough documentation for Mathematica. Though Mathematica is not free software, its 10,000+ pages of documentation are &lt;a class="link" href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/guide/Mathematica.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>available online&lt;/a>. Not only does the documentation for every function (usually including bullet points with Basic Examples, Scope, Generalizations &amp;amp; Extensions, Applications, Properties &amp;amp; Relations, and Neat Examples), it’s full of tutorials on various aspects of the language. Of you read the help inside of Mathematica, the files are simply notebooks, so the code can be evaluated within the documentation. I think you’d be hard pressed to find a language with better documentation.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="6-naming-conventions">6. Naming Conventions
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>If Mathematica wins one debate hands down, its naming conventions. By their own &lt;a class="link" href="http://reference.wolfram.com/mathematica/tutorial/NamingConventions.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>standards&lt;/a>, “As with most Mathematica functions, the names are usually complete English words, fully spelled out.” If you know the mathematical name for something, you can probably guess the Mathematica form.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Stephen Wolfram wrote a &lt;a class="link" href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2008/01/10/ten-thousand-hours-of-design-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>blog post&lt;/a> a few years ago on his personal role in naming Mathematica functions. Perhaps not too different from his late friend Steve Jobs, Wolfram desires intense control of the finest details of his products.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>I just realized that over the course of the decade during which were developing Mathematica 6—and accelerating greatly towards the end—I spent altogether about 10,000 hours doing what we call “design reviews” for Mathematica 6, trying to make all those new functions and pieces of functionality in Mathematica 6 be as clean and simple as possible, and all fit together.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>I think this has paid off.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Some people would complain about a language such an enormous number of named expressions, but Wolfram (the man and the company) have been so careful in constructing it that it doesn’t feel bloated.&lt;/p>
&lt;h2 id="7-interactivity">7. Interactivity
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>In version 7, Wolfram introduced interactivity into Mathematica. The Manipulate function is one I have found extremely valuable. It allows you to parametrize an expression and adjust the parameters while seeing results in real-time. For example, you could use Manipulate to adjust the region over which a function is plotted:&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/02/alovestory_28.gif"

loading="lazy"
alt="alovestory_29.gif"
>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>A side benefit to the careful construction of the language is that functions with related behavior often have interchangeable expression lists. Manipulate can be replaced with Animate with no other changes.&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="8-continual-development">8. Continual Development
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>Thankfully, Wolfram hasn’t given up on Mathematica. It’s been in development now for nearly 24 years. Mathematica 7 (released in November 2008) introduced interactivity features, access to many data sets, and built-in parallel computing, among &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.wolfram.com/products/mathematica/newin7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>other things&lt;/a>.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Mathematica 8, released in November 2010, brought integration with Wolfram Alpha and free form input. I find myself using this frequently when I’m teaching calculus. For example:&lt;/p>

&lt;h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion
&lt;/h2>&lt;p>No doubt, Mathematica has its limitations&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>: Worlds worst undo. Not object-oriented. Closed platform. Expensive. No autosave. No data frame structure.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, for me, it’s an invaluable tool. Last semester, I saw a less computer savvy fellow graduate student writing out a huge table by hand. I don’t recall the name of what he was doing, but it was something to do with measuring the distance between permutations. I told him I could do it for him in a single line of Mathematica.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In just a few minutes I wrote him the following code. It ended up taking me more than one line, but I wrote the code much faster than he was generating it by hand. (His table was actually for the 4-permutation case, so it was 24x24 instead of 6x6.)&lt;/p>

Now that I study operations research, the problem is very real. Operations researchers are often limited in their pursuits by the challenges of $\mathcal{NP}$-hard &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_program" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>problems&lt;/a>, and many operations researchers spend their careers trying to solve hard problems. Last semester, I came across &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.core.ucl.ac.be/~wolsey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>a similar look&lt;/a> at the issue.)&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>A &lt;em>pessimist&lt;/em> might say that as most problems appear to be hard (i.e., their decision version lies in $\mathcal{NPC}$), we have no hope of solving instances of large size (because in the worst case we cannot hope to do better than enumeration), and so we should give up. A &lt;em>mathematician (optimist)&lt;/em> might set out to become famous by proving that $\mathcal{P=NP}$. A &lt;em>mathematician (pessimist)&lt;/em> might set out to become famous by proving that $\mathcal{P\neq NP}$. A &lt;em>mathematician (thoughtful)&lt;/em> might decide to ask a different question: Can I find an algorithm that is guaranteed to find a solution &amp;ldquo;close to optimal&amp;rdquo; in polynomial time in all cases&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. A &lt;em>probabilist (thoughtful)&lt;/em> might also ask a different question: Can I find an algorithm that runs in polynomial time with high probability and that is guaranteed to find an optimal or &amp;ldquo;close to optimal&amp;rdquo; solution with high probability? An &lt;em>engineer&lt;/em> would start looking for a heuristic algorithm that produces practically usable solutions. Your &lt;em>boss&lt;/em> might say: I don&amp;rsquo;t care a damn about integer programming theory. You just worry about our scheduling problem. Give me a feasible production schedule for tomorrow in which William Brown and Daughters&amp;rsquo; order is out of the door by 4 P.M. A &lt;em>struggling professor&lt;/em> might say: Great. Previously I was trying to develop one algorithm to solve all integer programs, and publishing one paper every two years explaining why I was not succeeding. Now I know that I might as well study each $\mathcal{NP}$ problem individually. As there are thousands of them, I should be able to write twenty papers a year. Needless to say they are all right. There is no easy and rapid solution, but the problems will not go away, and more and more fascinating and important practical problems are being formulated as integer programs. So in spite of the $\mathcal{NP}$-completeness theory, using an appropriate combination of theory, algorithms, experience, and intensive calculation, verifiably good solutions for large instances can and must be found&lt;sup id="fnref:3">&lt;a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>.&lt;/p>

The idea is that market prices take into account all the information currently available. If the efficient market hypothesis holds, an investor couldn&amp;rsquo;t consistently beat the market because his knowledge about the markets is no better than anyone else&amp;rsquo;s. An accompanying &amp;ldquo;joke&amp;rdquo; is that an economist would never bend over to pick up a $20 bill on the street. If there was really $20 to be taken, someone would have taken it already.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>As I&amp;rsquo;m moving towards research and away from classes in my PhD program, I sometimes find myself believing the efficient research hypothesis: if an idea I have is good and correct, someone must have had it already. I have the same temptation outside of school. On occasion, I consider an idea for a website or computer program but then decide that if it were really a good idea, someone would have had it already. This can&amp;rsquo;t always be right. I don&amp;rsquo;t know if markets are efficient or not; I&amp;rsquo;m neither an economist nor an investor. But the progression of knowledge certainly is not efficient. New things are always available to be learned and studied, and these things aren&amp;rsquo;t always obvious from the information currently available. Research (and other projects) requires more than just thinking of a good idea; it requires sweat and elbow grease.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>From Nuclear Weapons to Operations Research</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/from-nuclear-weapons-to-operations-research/</link><pubDate>Wed, 25 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/from-nuclear-weapons-to-operations-research/</guid><description>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/images/tanker.png" alt="Featured image of post From Nuclear Weapons to Operations Research" />&lt;p>In 1953, the eminent mathematician John Von Neumann (as they say, &amp;ldquo;Most mathematicians prove what they can, von Neumann proves what he wants&amp;rdquo;) wrote a letter to T. V. Moore of Standard Oil. Apparently, Moore had written Von Neumann about an operations problem he had. Eighteen tankers would transport fuel from La Salina to Las Piedras to Aruba. Moore wanted to &amp;ldquo;determine the economic value of increasing the number of berths for the loading of these tankers in La Salina from 3 to 4 or to 5.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>However, due to &amp;ldquo;weather, conditions in the ports of call, etc&amp;hellip; the comings and goings of the tankers are described in statistical terms only.&amp;rdquo; Significant uncertainty existed in the time between ports and in loading and unloading times. Because of the complexity added by these uncertainties, Von Neumann speculated that the system would be very difficult to describe analytically. A few years earlier, in 1946, Von Neumann and Stanislaw Ulam worked to solve the radiation shielding problem. And, &amp;ldquo;Despite having most of the necessary data&amp;hellip; the problem could not be solved with analytical calculations.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>In this similarly probabilistic system, Ulam and Von Neumann decided to approximate the results they needed instead by repeatedly generating possible outcomes based on statistical manipulations and a (pseudo) random number generator. Their code name for this project was &amp;ldquo;Monto Carlo.&amp;rdquo; Von Neumann suggested that Standard Oil could build a &lt;em>probabilistic&lt;/em> model of the tanker problem. For example, a trip from La Salina to Las Piedras might take 8 hours with a probability of .8 (good weather conditions), 10 hours with a probability of .15 (moderate weather), and 15 hours with a probability of 0.05 (poor weather). Based on this model and given a table of random numbers, he could simulate possible outcomes of a trip that (roughly) match reality.&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>The procedure would have to be somewhat like this: Represent each tanker by some form of record, e.g., by a punch card, showing its exit time from La Salina&amp;hellip;. Program calculations which will develop the further history of this tanker, always deriving those quantities which depend on chance&amp;hellip;, with the use of suitable tables of random numbers.&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Of course, Moore would not want to generate just one possible trip. But if the process was done repeatedly, the average benefit of having some number of berths in the simulation would be an approximation of the real benefit:&lt;/p>
&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>It is thus possible to trace the history of as many days of operation as desired (say, a few years). One can then work out the behavior of sufficiently large samples for any assumed number of berths and thereby get an evaluation of the economic significance of any particular arrangement (i.e. any particular number of berths).&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>The same method Ulam and Von Neumann used to understand radioactive particles (which behave probabilistically) could be used to model full shipments. Fortunately, Monte Carlo simulation now requires neither punch cards or random number tables. Von Neumann&amp;rsquo;s punch card method would quickly be replaced by computer programs and &lt;a class="link" href="http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/25172/Simple-Random-Number-Generation" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>pseudo-random number generation algorithms&lt;/a>. This early application of Monte Carlo methods to operations problems is one of many.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I have recently been looking at online stochastic scheduling problems. In these problems, a system is asked to fulfill some scheduling requests while there is uncertainty (perhaps uncertainty about what other requests will come or how long the job might take to complete). A common approach to these problems is to solve &lt;em>deterministic&lt;/em> scheduling problems based on Monte Carlo simulations of the future. The system somehow combines these various schedules to make a decision. There are many &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monte_Carlo_method#Applications" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
>applications of Monte Carlo methods&lt;/a> in other fields as well.&lt;/p>

&lt;blockquote>
&lt;p>If you had a room full of people with a graduate degree in [operations research], what things would nearly everyone in the room know?&lt;/p>
&lt;/blockquote>
&lt;p>Operations research is notoriously hard to define. According to the Institute for Operations Research and Management Science, “In a nutshell, operations research (O.R.) is the discipline of applying advanced analytical methods to help make better decisions.” I suspect graduate programs spend most of their time teaching those “analytical methods,” i.e. mathematical and computational techniques for modeling and solving problems related to decisions. Examples include Received exception: &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linear_programming" target="_blank" rel="noopener"

>course requirements&lt;/a> for OR PhD students at my university provide an upper bound for this problem: the only courses everyone must take are linear programming, nonlinear programming, and stochastic modeling. Some topics are surprisingly optional; in particular: simulation, statistics, integer programming/combinatorial optimization. John suggests that statistics PhD programs are similar. Topics diverge rather quickly after first year courses. Are all graduate programs like this? Is this a necessary evil (or evil at all)?&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Carrots, Oatmeal, Operations Research</title><link>https://tdhopper.com/blog/carrots-oatmeal-operations-research/</link><pubDate>Mon, 09 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://tdhopper.com/blog/carrots-oatmeal-operations-research/</guid><description>&lt;p>A former grad school classmate of mine lived largely off of oatmeal and carrots. Suppose he wanted to be sure to get 2000 calories/day, 60 milligrams of vitamin C per day, and no more than 40 grams of fat per day. How should he balance his intake of oatmeal and carrots while minimizing his expense at the grocery store? Suppose he eats \(S\) pounds of carrots per day and \(Q\) pounds of dry oatmeal. A pound of carrots contains 172 calories; a pound of oatmeal contains 1742 calories&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>. The total number of calories he gets in a day is \(172\cdot C+1732\cdot Q.\) To be sure he gets the adequate number of calories, he needs $$172\cdot C+1732\cdot Q\geq 2000.$$ A pound of carrots contains 0.839 grams of fat, and a pound of oatmeal contains 25 grams of fat. For the total amount of fat has to be less than 40: $$0.839\cdot C+25\cdot Q\leq 40.$$ A pound of carrots contains 19 milligrams of vitamin C, and a pound of oatmeal contains 15 milligrams of vitamin C. Since the total amount of vitamin C must be at least 60: $$19\cdot C+15\cdot Q\geq 60.$$ If  you graph these three inequalities, you get the blue region shown below. Any point in the blue region represents a combination of carrots and oatmeal that would provide sufficient nutrients without giving too much fat. What we want to know is which combination is least expensive.&lt;/p>
&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/01/Whats-a-Stigler-Diet-Feasible1.gif">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;p>A pound of carrots and a pound of oatmeal both cost about $0.50. So, we want &lt;em>to minimize&lt;/em> the function $0.5\cdot C+0.5\cdot Q$ while still staying inside the blue region. We can write all of these things in a form that operations researchers call a &amp;ldquo;linear program.&amp;rdquo;&lt;sup id="fnref:2">&lt;a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2&lt;/a>&lt;/sup>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>$$
\begin{align}\text{minimize }\;\; &amp;amp; 0.5\cdot C+0.5\cdot Q\\
\text{subject to }\;\; &amp;amp;172\cdot C+1742\cdot Q\geq 2000\\
&amp;amp;0.839\cdot C+25\cdot Q\leq 40\\
&amp;amp;19\cdot C+15\cdot Q\geq 60\\
&amp;amp;C\geq 0, \;Q\geq 0\end{align}
$$&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It turns out, the optimal solution is that my friend should eat 2.44 pounds of carrots per day and 0.91 pounds of oatmeal. With that combination, he&amp;rsquo;ll get all his nutrients, restrict his fat, and keep his grocery store bill as low as possible (about $1.73 per day!). Below, I show another graph of the possible carrot-oatmeal combinations. This time, the color of a point represents the cost of that diet. The optimal diet occurs at the black dot, i.e. where the graph is most red. The most expensive diet occurs at the bottom right corner, where the graph is most blue. That diet corresponds to eating nearly 48 pounds of carrots per day!&lt;/p>
&lt;p>&lt;a class="link" href="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/01/Whats-a-Stigler-Diet-Temp.gif" >&lt;figure>&lt;img src="https://tdhopper.com/uploads/2012/01/Whats-a-Stigler-Diet-Temp.gif">
&lt;/figure>
&lt;/a>&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Operations researchers use this sort of linear programming mathematical model to solve all kinds of problems. While I don&amp;rsquo;t know of anyone who uses linear programming to fix their diet, the economist George Stigler suggested many years ago it is possible. I will follow up with another post talking about &lt;a class="link" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stigler_diet" target="_blank" rel="noopener"
