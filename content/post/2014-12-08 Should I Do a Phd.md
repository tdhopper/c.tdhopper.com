Last year, I published nine interviews with Internet friends about how an academically-minded, 22-year-old college senior should work on a Ph.D. Many people have told me the interviews have been helpful for them or that they've emailed them to others.

I hope this continues to be a valuable resource. I'd encourage you to share this with anyone you know who is thinking through this question.

## Excerpts

### DR. JOHN D. COOK, FREELANCE CONSULTANT AND BLOGGER

\> There are basically two reasons to get a Ph.D.: personal satisfaction, and credentials for a job requiring a Ph.D.

\> If a professor has never worked outside of academia, I’d be skeptical of anything he or she says about “the real world.”

### DR. PAUL RUBIN, PROFESSOR EMERITUS

\> If you do not enjoy doing research, pursuing a Ph.D. will be difficult, unfulfilling and possibly pointless (since you will not want a job with research expectations).

\> Having both a masters and doctorate in mathematics is no better than having just a doctorate.

### DR. ERIC JONAS, POSTDOC AND SERIAL ENTREPRENEUR

\> My best advice to an undergraduate curious about the “experience” of graduate school is: work in a lab while you’re an undergrad.

\> A lot of people think of a PhD as being like an undergraduate degree in that you’ve “learned a lot of material”. This is false.

### MR. CARL VOGEL, DATA SCIENTIST

\> The world is full of miserable grad students.

\> Successful grad students aren’t like normal humans.

### DR. MELISSA SANTOS, DATA SCIENTIST

\> To some extent, the process of getting the Ph.D. helped me have the mindset of putting together methods and being creative in my approach to problems that I’m not sure I would have with just the masters degrees.

\> The only reason you HAVE to do a Ph.D. is to become a professor. 

### DR. PAUL HARPER, PROFESSOR OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH

\> A very common misconception is that applicants can simply pick a supervisor of their choice, but this requires mutual consent.

\> Perhaps the best way to summarise the life of a Ph.D. student is to look at the awesome Ph.D. comics ([phdcomics.com](http://phdcomics.com/)) by Jorge Cham, which are spot on

### DR. LAURA MCLAY, PROFESSOR OF OPERATIONS RESEARCH

\> It’s important to think about how a Ph.D. fits in with other life decisions. I definitely felt like it would be hard to go back to graduate school if I started another career

\> Let me be clear: a Ph.D. is not a Masters degree plus a little more coursework and a small project. 

### MR. MIKE NUTE, RECOVERING ACTUARY AND PH.D. STUDENT

\> More specifically, if you don’t think that getting the Ph.D. is going to be fun on its own, then there’s a strong chance you’ll be miserable and it will end badly.

\> This reinforces the last point above: the only real reason to do a Ph.D. program is for love of the subject.

### DR. OSCAR BOYKIN, SOFTWARE ENGINEER

\> The number one question: does he or she have a burning desire to do a PhD?

\> As a professor, you are running a startup that can never be profitable: you are always raising money and hiring.
