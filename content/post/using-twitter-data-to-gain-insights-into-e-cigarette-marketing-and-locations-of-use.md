The Journal of Medical Internet Research [recently published work](https://www.jmir.org/2015/11/e251/) I participated in while working at RTI International. I used machine learning and NLP techniques to filter and classify tweets mentioning electronic cigarettes.

\> This study examines Twitter posts about e-cigarettes between 2008 and 2013 to gain insights into (1) marketing trends for selling and promoting e-cigarettes and (2) locations where people use e-cigarettes.
