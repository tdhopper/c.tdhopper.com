I’ve been a professional Python developer for over a decade. Like many Python developers, I’ve faced the many challenges of Python packaging and dependency management. I’ve also come to love helping developers find the right tools to make their work easier and more productive.

I'm excited to announce that I'm writing the [Python Developer Tooling Handbook](https://pydevtools.com/), a free
ebook on Python developer tooling. This handbook covers a wide range of topics,
including build tools, linting, formatting, dependency management, virtual environments,
and more.

The book is currently a work in progress, and I'm excited to share it with you when it's
ready. If you want to be notified as soon as it's released, please consider signing up
