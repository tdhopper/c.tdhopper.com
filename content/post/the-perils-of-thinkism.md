From [Daniel Lemire](https://lemire.me/blog/2016/12/20/what-is-a-useful-theory/): 

> I was an adept, as a teenager and a young adult, of thinkism. Thinkism is the idea that intelligence alone can solve problems. I thought I was smart so that I could just sit down and solve important problems. One after the other. Whatever contributions I ended up making had little to do with sitting down and thinking hardâ€¦ and much more to do with getting dirty.
