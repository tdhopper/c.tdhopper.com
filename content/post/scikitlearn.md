I gave a talk at a recent Research Triangle Analysts meetup on scikit-learn, the excellent machine learning library for Python. You can see the [IPython notebook that I presented from](http://nbviewer.jupyter.org/format/slides/github/tdhopper/Research-Triangle-Analysts--Intro-to-scikit-learn/blob/master/Intro%20to%20Scikit-Learn.ipynb).
