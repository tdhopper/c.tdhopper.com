Ten years ago today, [John Cook](https://www.johndcook.com) published his
first blog post entitled [Moore’s law and software bloat](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/01/09/moores-law-and-software-bloat/), a brief observation on how "Software bloat has increased at roughly
the same rate as Moore’s law".

Since then, he’s written over 2,700 posts (nearly 1 per day) on math,
computing, software development, statistics, science, and more. His posts are
rarely long, but they always give me something to think about. Over the last
six years since I discovered his blog, John has encouraged me to

  * [engage with dead writers](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/11/30/dead-authors/)
  * [not look to diplomas for magic](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/11/24/fairy-dust-on-the-diploma/)
  * [take care in inverting matrices](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/06/13/matrix-condition-number/)
  * [cherish analytic functions](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/08/20/why-are-differentiable-complex-functions-infinitely-differentiable/)
  * [be slow to say "they has too much time on their hands”](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/11/07/creativity-and-criticism/)
  * [second guess the need to always be in front of a screen to be a programmer](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/02/28/programmers-without-computers/)
  * [use Bayesian methods to better order search results of customer-rated items](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/09/27/bayesian-amazon/)
  * [consider the benefits of portable, open-source tools](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2011/11/21/career-advice-regarding-tools/)
  * [have humility when analyzing data](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/02/18/the-data-may-not-contain-the-answer/)
  * [be skeptical of “elementary” statistical books](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/01/12/elementary-statistics-book/)
  * [not feel dumb for being frustrated with statistics notation](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2008/02/23/everything-begins-with-p/)
  * [think carefully about how _read_ code](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/11/10/oftware-archeology/)
  * [reevaluate what it would take for software to be bug free](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/10/08/nasa-buggy-software/)
  * [appreciate the massive importance of organization in software projects](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/06/18/most-important-skill-in-software/)
  * [understand the real challenges of effectively applying mathematics](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2016/05/15/bring-out-your-equations/)
  * [wonder if time-spent-at-desk is a good proxy for getting work done](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2012/08/27/work-or-rest/)
  * [better understand why software projects fail](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/06/04/software-challenges/)
  * [realize that it’s sometimes better not to produce more code](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2009/12/23/why-programmers-are-not-paid-in-proportion-to-their-productivity/)
  * [realize automating might help me more by saving _mental energy_ than by saving _time_](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2015/12/22/automate-to-save-mental-energy-not-time/)

John earned his Ph.D. in applied math at UT Austin in 1992 with a dissertation
on partial differential equations entitled [Diffusion models with
microstructure and secondary
flux](http://catalog.lib.utexas.edu/search~S2?/acook/acook/1%2C109%2C119%2CB/frameset&FF=acook+john+douglas+++++1966&1%2C1%2C).
In the years since, he has worked as a math professor at Vanderbilt, a
software developer, a research statistician at M.D. Anderson Cancer Center,
and, since 2013, an independent consultant in statistics, mathematics, and
[HIPAA expert determination](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/expert-hipaa-deidentification/). His breadth of career experience reflect his breadth of
interests that make his blog what it is.

Though John has (wisely) avoided labeling himself a data scientist (preferring
[very applied mathematician](https://www.johndcook.com/veryappliedmath.html)),
his writings have shaped every aspect of my trajectory from being a operations
research grad student to a practicing data scientist. John is an [expert in
Bayesian statistics](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/bayesian-consulting/), yet
has [taught me much humility](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/01/01/making-sense-of-a-probability-problem-in-the-wsj/) about the power of statistics. John is a[
expert programmer](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/stand_alone_code/), yet
[points me back to the importance of soft
skills](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2014/10/02/the-mistakes-of-others/) for
the success of software projects. John [loves applications of mathematics](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2017/12/12/efficiency-is-not-associative-for-matrix-multiplication/), yet reminds me to step back and see
the [intrinsic beauty of mathematics](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/01/04/new-prime-number-record-50th-mersenne-prime/).

brings a unique approach in his posts on
[music](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/tag/music/) and has a neat collection
of [interviews](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/tag/interview/) he's done with
[Fred Brooks](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/05/26/fred-brooks-interview/), [Michael Atiyah](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2013/09/24/interview-with-sir-michael-atiyah/) and others.

John’s blog is not his only educational outreach. He maintains [17 (!) Twitter
accounts](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/twitter_page/) where he teaches about
technical topics in ~~140~~ 280 characters or less. I'm always learning little
tidbits from [@UnixToolTip](https://twitter.com/UnixToolTip) and find my
schooling refreshed by [@AlgebraFact](https://twitter.com/AlgebraFact) and
[@AnalysisFact](https://twitter.com/AnalysisFact).

One of John’s areas of expertise is implementing numerical algorithms in code.
On his website, he has a [handful of technical
notes](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/notes/) on this that many people have
found invaluable. Two years ago, I did [a quick
survey](/blog/mentions-of-john-cook-on-github/) of John’s
articles mentioned in Github repos. Hundreds of repos cited his [Accurately
computing running
variance](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/standard_deviation/) article. No
doubt countless more have used his resources without citing him!

Here's to 10 more years, John!
