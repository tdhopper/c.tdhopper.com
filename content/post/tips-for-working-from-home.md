I've been working remotely for tech startups for six years, so I am sharing some tips for those working from home for the first time.

1. **Start Working Early**\
   If you can't find someone to chat with for 30 minutes while making coffee, consider starting your workday instead.
2. **Simulate Office Noise**\
   If you miss the background noise of your office, try listening to 8 hours of power drill noises [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mNu4cNgJ-Hs). For a more realistic ambiance, you can overlay it with the most annoying laugh ever [here](https://youtube.com/watch?v=9WcSaIAa5Ac).
3. **Afternoon Activities**\
   Without a ping-pong table at home, you might find yourself with nothing to do but work in the afternoons.
4. **Familiarize Yourself with Remote Tools**\
   Programmers, take some time to get used to the essential tools for remote work, such as Jira, GitHub, Slack, and Zoom.
5. **Engage in Local Politics**\
   If the quarantine lasts longer than expected and you start to miss petty workplace politics, consider joining your local HOA.
