# üëã Hey, I'm Tim Hopper! 

I'm an experienced machine learning engineer and Python developer. I specialize in cloud infrastructure, machine learning platforms, and Python developer tooling.  

üë®‚Äçüíª **Currently**: Staff Software Engineer, Machine Learning at [Varo Bank](https://www.varomoney.com/).

## üë®‚Äçüî¨ Professional Interests:
- Machine Learning & Data Engineering
- Python Developer Tooling
- Cloud Infrastructure (AWS)
- DevOps & Automation
  
üñ•Ô∏è **Personal Projects**: 

I have an [occasional podcast](https://podcast.tdhopper.com) where I talk to friends about things they're interested in. You can find it in your podcast directory or at [podcast.tdhopper.com](https://podcast.tdhopper.com). 

Years ago, I created [Should I Get a Phd?](https://shouldigetaphd.com) where I interviewed nine friends about whether a young, bright student should consider pursuing a PhD. This it the resource I wish I'd had before starting a PhD program, and it's been useful to many.

[Python Plotting for Exploratory Data Analysis](https://pythonplot.com) is a Rosetta Stone for Python plotting libraries, and it also compares them to the GOAT of plotting libraries: ggplot.

I created [Notes on Dirichlet Processes](https://dp.tdhopper.com) after working on a [DARPA](https://www.darpa.mil) funded open source project for developing [Bayesian nonparametric models in Python](http://datamicroscopes.github.io). I did a lot of work to understand Bayesian nonparametrics and derive the Gibbs sampler for Hierarchichal Dirichlet Processes. [Notes on Dirichlet Processes](https://dp.tdhopper.com) shares what I learned for the benefit of others.

I enjoy wildlife and nature photography in my free time. [dothopper photo](https://photos.tdhopper.com) is my gallary. 

[Free Disk Space](https://freespace.tdhopper.com) is a little site I maintain with commands for freeing up disk space on your computer.   

üó£Ô∏è **Talks**:

I've been speaking at conference and meetups for many years. I keep a list of my recorded talks [here](http://tdhopper.com/talks/).
