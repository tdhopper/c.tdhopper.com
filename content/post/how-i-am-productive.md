I consider myself a productive and organized person. At a minimum, people come to me for things because they know I get things done. This doesn't come naturally to me, and it's a skill I've developed over the past 15 years. 

Here are some of the things I do to be productive:

## Write things down

I loosely follow the [Getting Things Done](https://getdrafts.com) method developed by David Allen. The most important aspect to me has been capturing tasks in a single inbox. I use the [Drafts](https://getdrafts.com) app on iOS and macOS, which lets me capture notes with zero friction. If it's a task I'm writing down, I use a Drafts action to send it to my [Omnifocus](https://www.omnigroup.com/omnifocus) inbox. I regularly triage my inbox to organize my tasks into relevant projects and contexts (e.g., tasks that can be done on the computer, tasks to do at home). 

## Using nagging reminders

Tasks that _must_ be done at a certain time aren't fit for my Omnifocus task management systems. For example, my trash must go out on Monday nights, and I need to be reminded until it happens. I love the [Due app](https://www.dueapp.com) on iOS, which will remind me repeatedly until the task is complete. 

## Tame email

I keep my email tidy. A big part of this is using [Sanebox](https://www.sanebox.com) to keep unimportant emails out of my inbox; Sanebox automatically detects, labels, and archives inbox clutter like receipts, marketing, and newsletters. These typically don't require any action and can be triaged as necessary. I aggressively hit the "Unsubscribe" button on things I don't need to be bothered with (including most marketing).

When an email can be handled quickly (within a minute or two), I try to handle it as soon as I receive it. If an email requires work to follow up on, I forward it to my [Omnifocus]() inbox and make it a task.

When this works well, my email inbox is normally empty. 

## Forget passwords

I have hundreds (thousands?) of logins to websites and apps. Even if I could use the same password for all of them, this is a notorious security risk. 

Every password I use lives in my [1Password](https://1password.com) account. I also use it to manage 2-factor authentication pins, credit cards, WiFi passwords, and personal information (social security numbers, driver's license scans, etc.). Using the 1Password keyboard shortcuts, I can quickly log in to any of my accounts. 

I know my 1Password master passwords and almost no other passwords to my accounts. They're typically long, randomly generated mixtures of characters.

1Password also lets me have a shared vault with my wife, which is invaluable for our shared services.


## Keep Slack under control

Like many tech workers, much of my day is spent in Slack. A few years ago, I stumbled upon [Michael Lopp's guide to optimizing Slack](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-i-slack-2022/). His approach greatly improved my experience with Slack and kept it from being a constant distraction. [Go read his post.](https://randsinrepose.com/archives/how-i-slack-2022/)

## Don't waste 15 minutes

Like the next guy, I'm often inclined to spend 15 minutes of downtime scrolling Instagram. However, I once heard advice from a productive person that a key to productivity is not wasting those short intervals.

When I have free minutes (sitting in a waiting room or during a short interval between meetings), I look for a task I can knock off my to-do list. I'm regularly surprised that daunting tasks can be finished in little time.

## Don't waste idle brain cycles

Some tasks (like writing this blog post) are hard to complete in one sitting.    I have difficulty developing new ideas in front of my computer with all its distractions. On the other hand, I'm a [strong believer in the power of noodling on ideas](https://tdhopper.com/blog/on-inspiration/).

When developing ideas, I prime my brain by dumping my thoughts on the topic into a Drafts app note and then thinking about it as I go about my day. When I have things to add, I pull up the note and jot down my ideas.
