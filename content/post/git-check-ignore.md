\[Git has](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-check-ignore) a `git check-ignore -v <pathname>\` option which will explain to you why a given file is ignored by the repository. This is helpful for debugging \`.gitignore` and other exclude options. 

I hope you never need this, but you'll be glad if you do.
