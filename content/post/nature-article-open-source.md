Back in 2015, I tweeted "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day. Write a program to fish for him and you maintain it for a lifetime."

In 2019, that tweet appeared in [a Nature article about the challenges of releasing open source software](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02046-0).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.<br><br>Write a program to fish for him and you maintain it for a lifetime.</p>&mdash; Tim Hopper (@tdhopper) <a href="https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/661551195291574272?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 3, 2015</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
