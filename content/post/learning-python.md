description: The post recounts the my journey with Python, highlighting how "Learning Python" by Mark Lutz significantly impacted my career.

On January 7, 2011, [I
tweeted](https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/23515755127508993), "Trying to
learn Python. We'll see if this keeps up once classes start."

On January 20, 2011, ten years ago today, I bought Mark Lutz's [Learning Python](https://amzn.to/3sHDwXa) from O'Reilly Books. Over the next month, I
read it on my Kindle on the Stairmaster at the school gym. It changed the
course of my adult life: since reading that book, I've written Python on more
days than I haven't.

Before discovering the data science Twitter community in late 2010, I'd only
heard of Python through another student researcher in my 2007
[REU](https://www.nsf.gov/crssprgm/reu/) who had used Python for some graphics
programming research. On Twitter, people like [Hilary
Mason](https://twitter.com/hmason), [John
Cook](https://twitter.com/JohnDCook), and [Chris
Fonnesbeck](https://twitter.com/fonnesbeck) talked warmly about using Python
in their scientific work.

In 2011, I was a first year operations research student at North Carolina
State University, and I realized that I should pick up programming again to
improve my career prospects. I'd taught myself some PHP in high school (circa
2003). In undergrad, I did a computer science minor and learned a good bit of
C++ and did a lot of Mathematica scripting in my math coursework, but, from
2008 to 2011, I basically didn't program.

[I struggled to use
Python](https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/132924915526533120) in practice
for ML/scientific computing in those days before wheels (binary installs);
libraries like Scipy and Numpy required brittle compilation of C++ and Fortran
dependencies. During the summer of 2011, I gave up using Python ([after
segfaulting](https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/73798291648811008)
[Orange](https://orangedatamining.com/)) for my internship at [Kiva Systems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Robotics) and dove in to R where
I could install packages more reliably and use
[ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

For some reason (probably because of Twitter), I returned to Python a year
later and used it to write my research code in grad school (despite my
advisor's wishes that I use C++). [Scipy Superpack](https://github.com/fonnesbeck/ScipySuperpack) for installing the
Scipy stack was invaluable (thankfully now replaced by Wheels and Conda).

My experience with Python was a big reason I got hired at [RTI International](https://www.rti.org/) when I left my Phd program in October
2012. They were looking to reduce their SAS dependency (and costs) and wanted
people experienced with open source tools. I taught a "Python for
statisticians" seminar to my colleagues soon after joining RTI.

From RTI, I joined Parsely which was like Python bootcamp working with [Andrew Montalenti](https://amontalenti.com/) and others. Parsely uses Python across
their full stack, and it was an eye opening and educational year for me.

Since then, I've worked at a variety of companies where I've been able to use
Python for training machine learning models, building machine learning
platforms, [writing Gibbs samplers for nonparametric Bayes](https://dp.tdhopper.com), building data engineering pipelines, software
testing, etc.

I use Python almost every single day for work and a lot of personal projects.
I've been able [to speak](/talks) at 3 PyData conferences,
a Scipy conference, and a number [Triangle Python Users Groups](https://www.meetup.com/tripython/). I had a [contribution merged into CPython in 2019](https://github.com/python/cpython/pull/11847) and have
contributed to many other open source projects.

I'm grateful to the countless people who have taught me (through tweets, code
reviews, conferences talks, etc) about Python and the many who have built the
wonderful language with its incredible ecosystem of tools and packages that
enable me and others to do so many things.
