Washington devoted far more time to the onerous task of draft letters than
leading men into battle. Running an embryonic government, he protested to
Congress that he and his aides "are confined from morn till eve, hearing and
answering the applications and letters of one and another," leaving him with
"no hours for recreation." He groaned at the huge stacks of correspondence
and felt besieged by supplicants for various favors. At times the enormous
quantity of paperwork must have seemed more daunting than British arms.
