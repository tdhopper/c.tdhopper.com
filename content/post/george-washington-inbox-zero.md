[Ron Chernow](https://amzn.to/3e3NppS) on George Washington's struggle with
mail:

> Washington devoted far more time to the onerous task of draft letters than
> leading men into battle. Running an embryonic government, he protested to
> Congress that he and his aides "are confined from morn till eve, hearing and
> answering the applications and letters of one and another," leaving him with
> "no hours for recreation." He groaned at the huge stacks of correspondence
> and felt besieged by supplicants for various favors. At times the enormous
> quantity of paperwork must have seemed more daunting than British arms.
