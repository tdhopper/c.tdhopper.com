I had the honor of being a technical reviewer for John Myles White's outstanding book, "[Bandit Algorithms for Website Optimization: Developing, Deploying, and Debugging](https://amzn.to/4g8G1K8)." I strongly suggest it to anyone curious about the subject. This book is an excellent start to understanding the field and provides practical advice on applying these algorithms effectively.
