In the winter, I was able to
[interview](https://podcast.tdhopper.com/001.html) two of my professional
heroes, Josh Wills and Oscar Boykin, about the last ten years of data science.
I published this under the [Into the Hopper](https://podcast.tdhopper.com)
podcast.

This week, I [interviewed my friend Joel
Grus](https://podcast.tdhopper.com/002.html) about his amazing new [Fizz Buzz
Book](https://fizzbuzzbook.com).

I hope to release more episodes on machine learning, data science, software
engineering, etc in the future, but Iâ€™m not promising consistent releases.
