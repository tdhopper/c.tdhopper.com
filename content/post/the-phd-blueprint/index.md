Years ago, I published a [collection of interviews](/phd) with people I respected about whether a young person should pursue a Ph.D. I still hear from people who found them helpful.

This is a slide deck version of the key questions from those interviews. If you're wrestling with this decision, I hope it gives you a useful framework.

{{< figure src="page-02.png" link="page-02.png" alt="You're at a Crossroads: You're academically talented, you enjoy your subject, and you have a funded Ph.D. offer. You also suspect you could get a good job right now. This guide gives you the right questions to ask yourself." >}}

{{< figure src="page-03.png" link="page-03.png" alt="Question 1: Why do you really want a Ph.D.?" >}}

{{< figure src="page-04.png" link="page-04.png" alt="Deconstructing Your Why: For Personal Satisfaction (love your subject), For a Specific Career (become a professor), or As a Default Path (warning against this)." >}}

{{< figure src="page-05.png" link="page-05.png" alt="Question 2: Are you prepared for the reality of the path?" >}}

{{< figure src="page-06.png" link="page-06.png" alt="Specification Sheet: The Ph.D. by the Numbers - Timeline (5-7 years), Career Odds (2-3% tenure track), Financials (10x less than industry), Attrition Rate (~35% drop out)." >}}

{{< figure src="page-07.png" link="page-07.png" alt="A Ph.D. is a fundamentally different experience: Undergrad is learning known information with clear deadlines; Ph.D. is producing new knowledge with little external guidance." >}}

{{< figure src="page-08.png" link="page-08.png" alt="Question 3: Are you built for this?" >}}

{{< figure src="page-09.png" link="page-09.png" alt="The Researcher's Personality Test: Inquisitive, Disciplined, Obsessive, and Delusional (believing you can uncover something new and important)." >}}

{{< figure src="page-10.png" link="page-10.png" alt="The Skills Checklist: Technical (analytical software, programming), Academic (self-study, reading literature), Communication (structured writing)." >}}

{{< figure src="page-11.png" link="page-11.png" alt="Question 4: What are your alternatives (and have you seriously considered them)?" >}}

{{< figure src="page-12.png" link="page-12.png" alt="Exploring the Alternatives: Go to Industry, Get a Master's First, or Take Time Off (with pros and cons for each)." >}}

{{< figure src="page-13.png" link="page-13.png" alt="Question 5: If you go, what is your plan to succeed?" >}}

{{< figure src="page-14.png" link="page-14.png" alt="Designing Your Program & Process: Choose Your Advisor Wisely, Investigate the Culture, Set Your Own Agenda." >}}

{{< figure src="page-15.png" link="page-15.png" alt="Your Blueprint is Personal: 1. Why do you really want this? 2. Are you prepared for the reality? 3. Are you built for this? 4. What are your alternatives? 5. What is your plan to succeed?" >}}
