Years ago, I published a [collection of interviews](/phd) with people I respected about whether a young person should pursue a Ph.D. I still hear from people who found them helpful.

This is a slide deck version of the key questions from those interviews. If you're wrestling with this decision, I hope it gives you a useful framework.
