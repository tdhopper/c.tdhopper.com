A few weeks back, I was browsing Google Maps and noticed the word "DEMO"
written in faint green letters in rural South Sudan. A journalist came across
this tweet and [wrote about it for
bbc.com](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48444703).

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><p lang="qme" dir="ltr">🤔 <a href="https://t.co/TOJvHsxdD9">https://t.co/TOJvHsxdD9</a> <a href="https://t.co/UtHG6Jpgxz">pic.twitter.com/UtHG6Jpgxz</a></p>&mdash; Tim Hopper (@tdhopper) <a href="https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/1133413170909982720?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 28, 2019</a></blockquote> <script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>

Way back in 2015, I tweeted "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
Write a program to fish for him and you maintain it for a lifetime." Today,
that tweet appeared in [a nature.com article about the challenges of releasing
open source software](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02046-0).
