A few weeks back, I was browsing Google Maps and noticed the word "DEMO"
written in faint green letters in rural South Sudan. A journalist came across
this tweet and [wrote about it for
bbc.com](https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-48444703).

Way back in 2015, I tweeted "Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day.
Write a program to fish for him and you maintain it for a lifetime." Today,
that tweet appeared in [a nature.com article about the challenges of releasing
open source software](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02046-0).
