I recently gave to the [Duke Big Data Initiative](http://bigdata.duke.edu/) entitled _<s>Dr.</s> Hopper, or How I Quit My Ph.D. and Learned to Love Data Science_. The talk was well received, and [my slides](https://twitter.com/tdhopper/status/827239362404433922/photo/1) seemed to resonate in the Twitter data science community.

Here's my favorite section from the talk:

{{< figure src="dd3.png" alt="What I thought I would do vs. what I tell people on Twitter I do" >}}

{{< figure src="dd4.png" alt="What I actually do" >}}

I conclude by listing things I learned in school but don't use every day:

* Linear Algebra
* Probability
* Statistics
* Machine Learning
* Math Modeling
* Data Structures
* Algorithms
* Distributed Systems

And things I wasn't taught in school but use daily:

* Communication
* Careful Thought
* Prose Writing Skill
* Software Writing Skill
* Software Engineering
* Tenacity
* Stack Overflow
