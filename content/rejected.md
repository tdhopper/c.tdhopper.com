title: Companies I've interviewed with but was not extended an offer by

This list is a follow-up to my popular post [Some Reflections on Being Turned Down for a Lot of Data Science Jobs](/blog/some-reflections-on-being-turned-down-for-a-lot-of-data-science-jobs/).

People talk freely about jobs theyâ€™ve been offered but are naturally hesitant to mention rejections.

For those new to the industry, this gives the impression that those who are more senior are drowning in job offers.

My goal is to make it clear that even someone with a successful career of 10+ years receives rejections, and we all need to keep persevering.
